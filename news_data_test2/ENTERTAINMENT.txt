'Sister Act' Remake Proves Hollywood Needs To Stop. 
What Was It Like to Be a Part of the MIT Blackjack Team?. Well, the whole thing was completely secret, for years and years and years.   So it was something you were doing where you couldn't tell anyone. We were totally paranoid about security--it was an all-cash business-- and the casinos could throw you out at any time - so it was all hush hush. From the beginning in 1979, I never talked about it publicly  until after the movie came out in 2008.

Feeling Grumpy About Disney Magic. \Touch Mickey to Mickey,\ the Disney employee instructed me, a tinge of frustration creeping into her mandatorily sunny Disney disposition. \I'm trying,\ I replied, tempted to add a profanity or two before remembering that, this being Disney World, there were bound to be children nearby.

I want Mad Max to Drive My Kia Rondo. OK, I'll admit it. I'll admit that I was skeptical when I heard about the \remake\ of Mad Max. I enjoy powerful and happy nostalgia for the giddy \I-don't-give-a-flying-f\ exuberance of the first two movies.

Can We Say So Long, but Not Goodbye, to Dave?. If I headed any network, I would never let a comedy treasure like him retire.  David is still at the top of his game and has so much more to give.

Mad Men Gets It So Right. I was scared of Mad Men for a long time. Even as it racked up Emmys and accolades, I wouldn't watch. I'd lived through Happy Days and other treacly tributes to the '50s and '60s that didn't ring anything like true. They'd glossed over or just plain avoided the ugly stuff I'd lived through as a black girl growing up in that very white world.

Woody Allen's 'Irrational Man' Premieres at Cannes. Any film that begins with a philosophy professor, played by Joaquin Phoenix, cruising in the bright sunlight musing to himself about Kant's  \unanswerable\ questions is going to charm me immediately. Indeed, Woody Allen's Irrational Man, which just premiered at Cannes, is a sunny joy to watch, despite its sinister subject:
Skateboarding's First Wave. Looking back, it's hard to believe what we did on those boards as kids.  What was exhilarating then now looks downright scary to me.

Rihanna Soaks Up The Sun In A Bikini. 
Movie Review. The directing debut of actor Chris Messina, Alex of Venice is as notable for what it doesn't do as for what it does.

Bill Pullman Is Back For 'Independence Day 2'. 
Podcast Review. It's great discovering new entries to Podcastland, particularly those that push the boundaries of what we get to hear.

The \u2018Meet Cute' Is Cute In Movies. In Real Life? Not So Much. 
Norman Reedus Shows Off His Crossbow Skills Against Jimmy Fallon. 
Fifty Shades of BS. All in all, the trilogy was entertaining, mindless reading, but I did find it to be a ridiculously insulting depiction of a modern, healthy female and relationship.  I'm not condemning you if you read the books as a guilty pleasure or if you go see and enjoy the movie. (I'll wait until it comes to Netflix.)
They're Back. Top (pronounced [z\u026a\u02d0 z\u026a\u02d0 top]) is an American rock band that formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band comprises guitarist

Valentine's Day Love with William and Kate and Other Historic Royal Couples Who Are Wildly In Love. 
For Your Consideration. This awards season, forget American Sniper. See the controversial movie Quebec separatists don't want you to see but conservationists can't wait for you to see but botanists forbid you to see but environmentalists say you must see. See Canadian Sniper--or at least its trailer. Go Canucks!
Jon Stewart Is Retiring, and it's Going to Be (Kind of) Okay. Stewart took the reins of The Daily Show as a goofy parody of local news, and turned it into something smart, influential and useful. It transcended mere entertainment. And it has done its job.
A Valentine Like No Other. 
That Major 'Simpsons' Theory Was Too Good To Be True. 
This Is The Real Talk You Need Before Valentine's Day. 
Movie Review. When James Bond rebooted with Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, the blend of old-school spy tale and modern-action sensibility seemed right -- if still a little restrained. Imagine now what would happen if James Bond were put in the hands of someone who was willing to not just rethink the secret-agent film but blow it up all together.

What Readers of Fifty Shades of Grey Want Their Male Partners to Learn From the Movie (If They Agree to Go See It). With the premiere of Fifty Shades the movie widely anticipated this Valentine's Day, I think it's important to look at what heterosexual men can learn about what women are seeking in the fantasy that is Christian Grey.
My 10 Random Insta-Grammy Observations From the 2015 Grammy Awards. I enjoyed Kristen Wiig's surprise appearance as Sia's stand in for \Chandelier,\ as Sia does not face the audience while singing. BTW, can Kristen Wiig be a stand in for me in all aspects of my life? Please and thank you.
The Bachelor Recapped By Someone Who Has Actually Been To Iowa, Unlike Any of the Contestants. We open with Kelsie having a fake panic attack while the other women gaze at her unmoved.  She is trying to make sure that Chris doesn't dump her after she insisted that Chris isn't going to dump her.  Kelsie looks sly and sneaky beneath her oxygen mask, which is no small feat.
Exclusive Interview. Rock City's new project #WhatDreamsAreMadeOf is an homage to St. Thomas and their struggle. They hope their new project can narrate the stories many have overcome and still face, specifically growing up disadvantaged and in poverty.
Zaki's Review. Unfortunately for the filmmakers, the audience, and (given the $175 mil price tag) the studio, Jupiter Ascending isn't exactly the second coming they were hoping for. Instead, it's a melange of misplaced ambition that's asphyxiated by tangled plot threads that are at once overcooked and undernourished.

A-Sides with Jon Chattman. Ariana Grande seems to be everywhere. She's got more singles out there than a J-Date mixer, just showed up on The Grammys, and I hear Starbucks will soon introduce the Ariana Grande-sized latte. OK, that last statement is a lame sense of humor, but let's face it the 20-something hottie is all over the place and deserves it.

Valentine, Smalentine. Dogs get the value of cuddling for its own sake. They like to snuggle up to you while you read in bed and while you polish your toenails and while you talk on the phone, and this is actually -- get this -- all they want.

Joan Rivers Just Won Her First Grammy. 
Who's A Better Liar. 
Rosie O'Donnell Takes on Brian Williams at the Athena Film Festival. The irrepressible Rosie O'Donnell could not help herself. Coaxed to do stand up on the not funny subject of her heart attack by HBO's Sheila Nevins, the television star created a routine that is more than the heartfelt in its title.
The Berlinale Diaries. I'll admit it can take just one film to usually convince me to come to a film festival. In the case of this year's Berlinale, it was Jafar Panahi's Taxi. I knew I wanted to sit in that bursting at the seams press screening, first thing in the morning, to watch it. And, as is usually the case with my cinematic instinct, I was right.
\Forever\ Needs a Fact Checker. Forever has a strong female lead, generally good scripts, and Gruffudd's opening and closing reflections are often thought-provoking. But I wonder if the fact that the show is based in fantasy has made the writers lose their grip on reality and decide that whatever they think needs to be real for the show is real.

When It Comes to Disney's 101 Dalmatians, the 'de Vil' Is in the Details. It was actually Marc Davis' masterful work on the Mistress of All Evil for Sleeping Beauty that led to his being assigned Cruella de Vil. But given that 101 Dalmatians was Walt Disney Animation Studios' first film to be set in a contemporary setting, well, Davis wanted Cruella to be a real departure from everything that he'd done with Maleficent. He wanted her to be the first modern-day Disney villain.

Redemption Road. The one thing we can be sure of is that it will come from some place unexpected and from no one we've ever heard of before. It just doesn't move along in nice, orderly ways. Like everybody else, I feel a lack of social commitment in young artists, but I'm not about to criticize them.
Black or White. The new star vehicle for Kevin Costner \Black or White\ is, of course, both good and bad. The acting is generally good. The plotting and writing, generally not so much.

Mandy Moore And Ryan Adams Split. 
Podcast Review. One could have, perhaps, predicted the glut of pop culture-oriented podcasts that have sprung up. Hell, it's the linchpin for the recently launched WolfPop network of shows. Less understandable (at least to me) is the rise of the trivia-oriented podcast. Especially trivia AND comedy.
The Bawdy, Sexy Sundance Comedy Everyone Is Talking About. 
Where You Can See Great Women Comics Who Should Have Netflix or HBO Specials. Part I. With the boom in self-released, Netflix and HBO comedy specials, it sometimes seems there's too much of a glut of comedians unveiling their new shows.

In Defense of 'American Sniper'. Let me start by agreeing with the critics of American Sniper on one point.  The movie does present Iraqis in a one-dimensional way and doesn't spend much time trying to understand the complexities of the war. Yet the fuss over the film is still ridiculously overblown.

ReThink Review. I see soldier worship as harmful because it so easily morphs into support for wars, no matter how unjust, by letting our affection for our fellow citizens in uniform and our desire to see them come home alive obscure the truth behind what they're supposedly fighting and dying for, which is rarely as black and white as we are told or wish it to be.
