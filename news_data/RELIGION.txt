I understand why Donald Trump's sideshow antics are appealing. Who doesn't love locker room humor in a presidential election? What I don't understand is why all this mean-spirited craziness is appealing to evangelicals.

Human rights activism was deeply embedded in the life, history and spiritual philosophy of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel




Freedom without direction leads to confusion, and independence without rules creates chaos. That is why children need rules in order to grow, and adults need a compass in order to navigate the turbulent waves of our world.

In this wide-ranging conversation we learn about the iconic leader's spiritual formation in Tibet, his extraordinary escape from the Chinese, his interest in science, how he meditates and what compassion means in real life.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A prison that Pope Francis plans to visit during his U.S. trip houses a former church official jailed
When I first heard they forgave him, I flinched. Why should they have to do that? So quickly? My visceral response gave way to self-examination. Maybe the family members of those who died at Mother Emanuel are better Christians than I am, with a deeper faith.
Whatever our differences, Christian Americans should lend our ears, if not to Obama's call to our natures' better angels, at least to God's call for universal self-sacrifice and self-reflection on the whole range of pressing moral issues facing America.
I knew, even as a small child, how meaningful it was that my mother insisted on a life of truth, beauty, love and justice. Her courageous choices were about her, and they were also very much about us, her kids. She knew she had to live a life that would show her children how to fully live.
We are not flawless and the Hindu past is not unblemished. The future of our tradition, however, is not contingent on a perfect past or on immunity to criticism in the present.  It depends on its ability to address human problems and to promote the flourishing of all human beings.
The story of the church and LGBT rights is also my story. I first came back to church as a gay, recovering alcoholic. The church taught me that I was beautifully and wonderfully made; and that to love myself and care for myself was a form of gratitude to my Creator. Years later, after I had been with my partner for 11 years, I was married in the Episcopal church we now attend, and It was one of the most moving events of my life.

I slip out the door and join the flow of traffic up the street, noticing someone across it with his eyes fixed on the front of the bar. I reenter the shadows and make my way.
Dr. SreyReath Kuy and Dr. SreyRam Kuy were recently interviewed by Aimee Herd, Editor of Breaking Christian News (BCN).
Let everyone not wrapped in tired and disproven doctrines about sex rid themselves of anti-scientific dogmas and be free. The law of grace, not of fear, can now blow freely.
Those who have fought same-gender marriage now express fears that they will be called upon to do things their consciences will not permit and are clamoring for \religious liberty.\ I can't help but smile at their na\u00efvet\u00e9.
One again she thanked God that she escaped another brush with death, physically intact.
The opportunity now exists for the Episcopal Church to set a different example for how the future might unfold -- not just for itself, but for all the mainline churches. The way of doing that is not to focus on the top, but rather on the bottom, of the structure.


Isn't Mike Huckabee, someone who considers himself a man of faith, taking his Lord's name in vain?
Do I believe that most mosques today would let recovering alcoholics and drug addicts speak to their congregations? Probably not. Do I think there is a problem with that? Yes, definitely. Our failure to engage diversity in our communities, inclusive of diversity in terms of life experience, leaves us potentially stunted in our individual and communal growth.
Why are they so furious about a decision that can have no direct effect on them? A court majority that blithely made \money talks\ the law of the land in Citizens United really cannot  complain about \judicial tyranny\ when it finds itself in the minority.


I asked Robert Lee what he would say to Dylann Roof if he had a chance to talk to him, and how God would judge the mass murderer. He said
Can a faithful Christian support the court's decision? What can we say in response to questions voiced by some Christian people?
No portrait in any house had ever shocked me more. I recently drove through Mississippi, and stopped in a town known for its extensive pre-Civil War architecture.
Jesus, a great rabbi and master teacher, never said a word about your orientation/identity other than, \You are the light of the world.\ It is clear to me that if you were going to fry sunny side in hell for eternity because of who you are, he would have at least mentioned it.
I am rejoicing today, and ecstatic that in the years to come, the love that I share with my husband and the love that millions of other LGBT Americans experience will be honored and that LGBT people will have gained dignity and justice at last.
It remains to be seen if this racial atrocity will awaken the soul of white America and create a multiracial commitment against the lingering sins of systemic racism. Will the continuing racial injustice in America now be more forthrightly addressed -- by all of us? That will be the moral test of white America's soul.
Some people ask the question, is there really such a thing as \Islamophobia,\ or are Muslims merely indulging in a culture of victimhood? While most Muslims may feel that even to ask the question is an impertinence, there really are people out there asking it. So let's look at some facts.



Although it began in the nineteenth century in what was then Persia, the scriptures of the Baha'i Faith have some specific prayers and passages about the destiny of America that are thought-provoking.
Killing people in cold blood in a sacred space, trespassing on holy ground, I don't fully understand it, nor do I fully understand the faith of those still standing at Mother Emanuel's, after the horrors they've faced there.


I told them about how difficult and sad my life had been and how I had embarked on a spiritual journey to learn how to be happy. It was that journey that led to me peeling off the layers of fear and shame that had protected and cut me off from the world. Underneath, I discovered Abby.

It has been said that the task of a rabbi is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. We are all afflicted. We are afflicted by the horrific murder of nine people gathered for a Bible study at a church in South Carolina



Here is my list of seven life-areas I'm working on today so when tomorrow comes I have no regrets, knowing I did all I could to be the dad my kids love.
Contemporary Pagan religious practice commonly fosters a sense of spiritual connection with the Earth. Pagans actively try to cultivate a harmonious relationship with the non-human natural world.
I was already reeling from the video of Dominican citizens cutting the hair of a Haitian man with scissors as a crowd ridiculed him in the street for his dark skin. I prayed that the baseball bats and machetes would not be swung.
Pope Francis' encyclical on climate change, Laudato Si, is a bold and brilliant challenge to business as usual. Already, conservatives and liberals alike have mounted rebuttals in ways that illustrate the limits of their own ideologies.

Thank you. Before watching your monologue this morning I was numb. Perhaps it was after the Walter Scott video was shown over and over again or the pending repeat of the Parsley Massacre in the Dominican Republic.


I had read this verse over and over throughout my life, but when I read it that day, it felt like I was reading it for the first time.  I didn't know how to be appreciative, and the impact it was having on me was quite severe.

In honor of those nine souls and of the countless others who preceded them, we will continue to exist, to protest, to remain open, to stand, and to pray. The doors of the church are open.

The Rebbe's attention to my cry changed my life. Without a doubt, the attention that we will devote -- in the Rebbe's honor -- to someone else's cry, will also change other lives, heal our world, and carry on the Rebbe's shining legacy, for eternity.
It's very refreshing to know that mindfulness has grown over the years and has entered the mainstream today as one of the many ways of demonstrating prayer.
The Jewish world lost one of our greatest voices for feminism and for a just Zionism this week, Rabbi Bonna Devora Haberman\u200b. She was a founder of Women of the Wall, an activist and scholar, and co-director of YTheater, a Israeli Jewish and Palestinian theater company in Jerusalem.
Established by Reverend Richard Allen, a former slave and Methodist preacher, the A.M.E. is the oldest black denomination in the country. Its roots lie in one of the first black religious and mutual help societies, the Free African Society founded by Philadelphia blacks in 1787.
I think a lot today about Utoya, as the headlines report about Charleston.  Very different disasters, very different criminal acts, so convenient in an open society.  Where one has so much opportunity to harm, and far less urgency to do good.  Where hospitality is practiced, and sanctuary a distant dream.
I don't want to pray for Charleston. I can't. I am an Itinerant Elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, yet, prayer doesn't seem like enough. I need action. To my white Christian brethren, I don't need for you to tell me how angry you are. I need you to tell your white friends.
I worry that this primacy of hate over love means he and his kind have won something. I worry that my unwillingness to find forgiveness means I am surrendering something. I worry that for evil to prevail in the world it may be enough for bad people to make good people hate.
There's a reason the hateful choose houses of worship. It's because that's where so many of us put our hope. You can commit a hateful act anywhere, but if you really want to hurt a community, you choose the place they worship.
While we tend to speak of the United States as a nation based on freedom, none of us is truly free until all are free. We are bound by the spilling of the blood of our kindred spirits. For that, we mourn.
To that small minority who see this crime against humanity as a victory
When I woke up to news of another church shooting -- of nine people killed in the place you feel safest -- I only want to share the parts that ripped me up. The parts that are still confusing and raw. Because that's what it feels like when someone comes into your life with a gun and tries to kill you.



We as a nation must face racism and reject it --decry it boldly and change it in ourselves. And we must disarm. The storyline seems clear to me. Let this be the last time not the new normal.
Many in your church are aware of the terrible conditions of the Palestinians. My message, as a Palestinian Christian, is a simple one
Many Jews have stereotypical views of Evangelicals. These stereotypes may persist, but they lack validity. If we are to build meaningful and enriching bridges--bridges that enhance our faiths and ourselves--we need to address and overcome our lingering fears.


The causes of our environmental crisis are more complex than any single religion. We can neither vilify Christianity, nor idealize ancient pagan religions.

Deb and Steve Word have recently been praised by many media outlets including CNN, for taking in LGBT homeless youth. But for Word family it was an easy decision. That's why it's hard for them to understand why the Church refuses to help LGBTQ homeless youth in the first place.
Can Pope Francis and thousands of Catholic--and other--personnel recover, emerge, and get back to their vital work, regaining trust?
The keynote address by Patriarch Bartholomew served as a reminder not to undermine the sensory aspects of nature, but to embrace both the tangible and intangible experiences that shape values and actions.
Noah built an ark, commissioned by God. In Paris, architect Frank Gehry built an ark, commissioned by Louis Vuitton.
We must remember that when David was gathering those stones, the giant was still standing, still sucking in the air that those on the other side of the valley were desperately trying to breathe. We live in a time when too many giants are still standing. Poverty. Racism. Discrimination. Oppression. Inequality.
Dr. Vinya Ariyaratne leads one of the world's most admired development initiatives

Some would say that LGBT people can simply find another magistrate to marry them; indeed, the North Carolina law requires that one be made available. This does mitigate some of the harm.
What are the practices that lead to deep spiritual growth? How can fasting help focus attention on what matters? What do those who observe the fast hoping to learn?  These are the questions of the Holy Month of Ramadan.





Racism and bigotry can infect the fabric of a community, leading to a slow erosion of its democratic values and ideals. But what factors contribute to the rise of these judgments of character in the first place?
We call on President Obama and his administration to use all means to provide the full range of reproductive health care needed by women, girls, and their families throughout the world. Don't let broken policy practices continue to harm the health of women.
Efforts like those of EcoPeace come at a critical moment in human history. Environmental degradation and climate change have become the focus of concern for people of all faiths worldwide.
I just read an article entitled, \Can Gays and Christians Coexist in America?\ Once again, I find myself annoyed by the presumption--the enduring arrogance present in unself-critically asserting that the \Christian position\ with respect to LGBTQ people is by definition condemnatory.
Neither a single individual, a single passage, nor even a single religious tradition should be regarded as the source or solution for climate change.



Life is about learning the lesson of who you are and who the people around you are... But ultimately how you answer those questions depends on who you believe God to be. If you believe God to be the Great Judger, that has an effect on how you treat other people. And yourself. But when you start to see God as the Great Lover, the world changes.

Ironically, Sister Pat taught me to have faith. Not in God, but in people. Because there are people out there who are just amazing through and through. Who do good everyday for all the right reasons. And for me, that's even more impressive than an all-powerful being.
We're quick to love like Jesus when the people who need that love are already one of us, but when the people who need loving are people we don't like, people we're afraid of, or people whose lives we \don't agree with,\ we quickly and unapologetically exchange that love for wrath.



It's quiet in Kathmandu these days. For the last 20 years the city has been overpopulated with tourists and guest workers, all of whom have left, so it's emptier. But it's more than that. The quiet relates to a sense of fear.ai
People are just mean.\ Have you heard that before? \People are just mean?\ Like somehow that excuses or permits or allows for mean people to go on being mean.
The Seventh-day Adventist Church -- with a more than century-long track record of defending religious freedom and the rights of religious minorities -- early on recognized the critical religious liberty implications central to this case.

Continually Jesus drew our attention not to loving people \in general\ but to specifically caring for those we would tend to discount or condemn. Black lives matter is exactly the kind of thing Jesus would say.


In June 1988, I left active duty service as a Navy Chaplain. My Staff Chaplain position at the then Naval Station Great Lakes, Il command  was eliminated due to the infamous budget balancing legislative act known as Gramm, Rudman ,Hollings. This legislation passed despite not being terribly popular with significant numbers of Republican and Democratic legislators.
Church changed my life today. Last year, I started attending service at a local Baptist church. I was hired to paint abstract paintings during the praise portion of the church's Easter Sunday Service.
\The Jihad of Jesus
What kind of a world would it be if the stories and ideas that captured our attention reflected our common humanity? What if key search engine optimization terms were words like kindness, tenderness, forgiveness and humility?
When I was interviewing for my current pastoral job, one of the questions asked of me, in one of the many different conversations I had with various committees, was, \What does the Virgin Birth mean to you?\
Henry McNeal Turner's writing focused on much during the post reconstruction period. One of the first major debates Turner found himself in was on African missions and emigration.
When I was eight years old, my parents used to take me to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. We would go every week of the summer, spread out a blanket on the grass, and enact a tradition central to our monotheistic branch of Hinduism


In Ireland nearly every stranger you meet engages you in a bit, or more than a bit, of talk. An oldish priest entered behind me as I asked the receptionist where I might find Father Horgan.



Her natural awe, curiosity and excitement simply amaze me -- I wish I got even remotely as excited about anything as she does about buses!\u00a0But\u00a0if you spend any time with children, you'll notice that they just seem to have an innate sense of what we might call \spirituality.\


When Abraham first discovered the method of connection, he told about it to whomever would listen, and those who joined him became the first truly connected people.
Not long ago, when one walked the streets of Center City, the only women wearing flowing religious garb were Catholic nuns or maybe a few Anglican or Lutheran nuns.

It's easy to believe in redemption for yourself. I mean, come on, you aren't that bad. But, do you believe redemption is possible for everyone?

To manage our relationship to mortality and the overwhelming power of grief, we sanitize or sequester death and corpses with elaborate rituals and fierce taboos. But war explodes these boundaries and endangers the humanity of those we send to fight.
Paul Raushenbush has dropped two \c's\ from his famed Christian-theologian-minister great-grandfather Walter Rauschenbusch's name, but he reflects the ancestor's tradition, captures some of his spirit, and looks to the future in that spirit.

So predictable are the Pope's critics on the Right that we seldom engage in sighting them or commenting on them in Sightings. But never to notice them does a disservice to those who would like a full accounting of the Pope-in-public, the Pontiff-in-the media, etc.
Where does that leave us who have pledged our lives to this apparently dying institution? As Jesus says numerous times in the Gospels, \Be not afraid.\

Bill O'Reilly is wrong. Rap is not to blame for the current crisis in American Christianity. Blame Elvis, that's what I say. He is the main culprit in the current cultural transformation shaking the foundations of religion in America.
One document from the Bin Laden bookshelf is quite remarkable. It is no less than something entitled \Profiles of Bishops in the Church of England.\ At this point I could understand you checking the date to make sure that this is not a delayed 1 April blog -- but it isn't.



To paraphrase the Stark words from Game of Thrones, summer is coming. Ferguson and Baltimore are likely to be the beginning of a series of (looking for a neutral term here) conflicts. Thus, it behooves us to try to think about the recent events in Baltimore in clearheaded, non-partisan ways.

Religious groups have been particularly energized by the callous, even sacrilegious view of immigrants as illegals, criminals and threats, advanced by anti-immigrant politicians, media outlets and advocacy groups.

At the root of the culture wars lies a fundamental dichotomy in worldviews. Which is more essential to humanity



The Boston bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has been sentenced to death. The 21-year-old man who accompanied his brother on a journey of violence and terrorism will now live out the years of his appeals process until a lethal injection is administered to end his life. Certainly there are no winners.


Allan Badiner wanted to know what happened to the research with psychedelics by bright, spiritually-minded people so he decided to ask a wide spectrum of seekers what their experiences exploring the relationship between Buddhism and psychedelics was.
Nalandabodhi sponsored the final stop of HH the Karmapa's US tour last weekend, and the 1,200 people who attended his public teachings last Saturday had the rare and auspicious opportunity to spend some time with a revered young global spiritual leader.
Whether it's the Bible or the Constitution, every document written by human beings was written in a context, at a specific historic time, and is based on the level of consciousness of those who wrote them. Whether or not you think they are dictated by God, they are still fallible. How could that be?


We know that journalism can impact attitudes and action. But it's rare to get concrete proof of that, as I did recently after publishing a blog post about the anti-Semitic content of traditional Good Friday performances of Passion plays and Passion musical compositions, many dating back to the Middle Ages.

While Americans are still much more religious than Europeans, the overarching trends, highlighted by Pew, suggest that American society is indeed secularizing.
I didn't know the pastor who phoned me from Alabama. But my alarm bells went off the moment he identified himself as a \Bible-believing Christian.\




Hers is a kind of ecstatic spirituality that welcomes emotion and sensation. There will always be a time and place for contemplation and inquiry, but there is no wiser teacher than the present moment.

I had no idea that being in the same room as someone who passes away can be a \gift.\ Mainly because that had never happened to me before. And if asked, I would have said, \How awful.\ \nYet, being with Mom for her last breath, was anything but awful.
The surprising retirement of Pope Benedict XVI in February 2013 marked the end of a papacy reluctant to take on the full array of duties of the Bishop of Rome
I take our \come as you are\ philosophy very seriously, showing up every Sunday as I am. A little bit rock and roll, and every bit as transgender as I was the day before.
If we are at war, it's not a war against Islam. It's a war against hatred in all its forms, including anti-Muslim hatred. We cannot win this war by returning hate for hate, as Angelou so wisely noted. We must fight this war by employing our most powerful weapons
It's time to express gratitude to her, it restores the spiritual balance in each one of us.  Life is about transactions, each time we received a \good\ we become indebted to the giver, but when we give back to the giver or find alternate ways of giving back, then we regain our spiritual balance, bringing us nirvana.
The future of Islam depends on Muslims deciding whether we will be fueled by examples of hope or examples of hatred.

If you missed the memo, there's a very sad situation down in the Diocese of Central Florida wherein Baby Jack was denied the sacrament of baptism because Baby Jack happened to have two dads.
While I only offer a few visions for the future of spirituality here, each represents a challenge and an opportunity. Each also includes a paradox. With spirituality, paradoxes come with the territory. As always, we will do best to meet each possibility with knowledge, compassion, and common sense.
The question of women's leadership has long been a contentious issue in the Catholic Church. While Francis has changed the tone of the Church through his messages and actions, when it comes to women, many people agree
The state of race, culture and religion in America is a key metric for how we are evolving as a society. The question for the church in 2025 is do we have enough elasticity and self-awareness to accommodate other customs, and views different from our own?
The true meaning of a bar mitzvah. A charitable initiative like the one these boys have created combines their own passions, helps those less fortunate and brings more meaning into their Jewish coming-of-age ritual.
If Pope Francis really wants women to be paid fairly, there is something he can do today that would alter his culture in a disruptive and transformational way
Because they come from our heads (intellect) rather than our hearts, perhaps all words referring to God do nothing but get in the way, building a sense of separation from It. Perhaps Divinity lives so fully in our hearts as a feeling that the minute we name or label It something we automatically limit our experience of It by drawing boundaries around It.
In a pluralistic society, people have to accept that others do not hold their religious views with any reverence.

Scholars, religious leaders and journalists already see signs Pope Francis is making a difference.

My trip up my family tree taught me that none of us is separate from one another - neither as individuals nor as groups. As such, hate that is rooted in the illusion of that non-existent separation is nothing if not absurd.
I was in love with Orthodoxy for a long time. It was a warm down comforter and a pair of the perfect yoga pants. Comfortable, sacred belonging. There are still parts that remain beautiful to me.






We all know what it's like to be so frustrated that we are tempted to damage something or someone we hold dear. That could be punching a wall, throwing a dish or cell phone, or sadly enough, assaulting a loved one. None of these responses are justified or right. Hence, we need a remedy.


America ought to be better than these statistics imply. It's time for us to live up to the moral values espoused so long ago by Adam Smith. The real Adam Smith, that is.




How should one decide what to believe? If you're looking for a religion, here are six suggestions that are much more fun and in some ways make more sense than the mainstream ones.
We've killed women and children, sir. We've killed innocent men. That they didn't have the good foresight to be born to American parents or on American soil matters not at all to the God who created them and who, Jesus says, still loves them.
Joan Driver was so special in one spectacular way. Have you ever known ANYONE who has never had an unkind thing to say about anyway....and not in a sanctimonious way at all...she was just that good.


When my children squabble, I see how very young they are, and how very little they understand. Their truths are true, but partial. When my children squabble, there is anger. There are tears. When my children squabble, I love them and am for them.
The question I'm asking is this
Men have run the world for a long time. We can easily see where this unbalanced and abusive gender dominance, including \manly Christianity,\ has gotten us. It is ugly and destructive. It is beyond time to bring women to the table at both local and high, global levels for peace and security.
The Israeli Independence Day always gets me pensive. With its reliance on military and monetary aid from the US, and its extensive export to Asia, Europe, and North America, it's ironic, almost sardonic to think of the state of Israel as independent.



How can we ensure the survival of the American Jewish identity? And further, is it important? In my humble opinion, the survival of the Jewish people around the world is nothing short of a miracle.
It's hard to take seriously the narrative of widespread marginalization and, on top of that, oppression, when the American landscape remains saturated with Christianity in numerous shapes and forms.

Always intrigued by the traditions of others, I wanted to find out how Family Home Evening affected Mormon life.


It's the time of renewal in the northern hemisphere. So how does a Sikh Religion professor who teaches at a Lutheran university celebrate Vaisakhi? Well, here's how the day of April 14, 2015 shook out.
What really hurts the Church's witness is proclaiming that all are one in Christ Jesus our Lord while working hard to pass laws that exist for the sole purpose of discrimination.
When we do our \gratitude inventory\ (aka, a way to get them to reflect and pray), they rattle off things as a matter of routine that many people would only dream of.





What Conservative Christians are really upset about, deep down, is not that one or a few or dozens or hundreds of their fold are being attracted by liturgical traditions and progressive theology. What they are really upset about is that their ways and their positions of privilege in the world are dying.

The struggle for me was that I was hiding this experience, because deep in my heart, I thought I was crazy or different and didn't want anyone to find out. Throughout my life I have always had a soft voice that has comforted me and directed me to do what is right.
As a youth I thought being the son of survivors was a burden, but I gratefully came to see it as a gift because it not only gave me a mission, it was the first subject that animated my writing. It's what helped me find my voice.
Like everyone, Karl Barth is limited to his historical and cultural and political context, but like all great theologians, he has the capacity to speak to universal ideals, morals and beliefs.

Why should Jews invoke their plight on Yom HaShoah? Because part of the memory of our collective experience, is standing up for the helpless, rendered voiceless by evil-doers.


As a Muslim, who has followed this polarization of narratives, I am convinced that all opinions deserve to be heard and not just marginalized as either \Islamophobia\ or \Jihadism,\ albeit with caution. Prejudice is a common human failing which people of all faiths are capable of.
Boo is sweet term, but bae is something else altogether. Before anyone else. That's serious talk. Who is your before anyone else? Would my bae be my son? My husband? It took a few moments, but I realized that my bae is my God.
Becoming a Green Sanctuary is how my church chose to uphold the values of our green principle.

Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation is the subtitle of the book, America's Pastor, an acclaimed sort-of-biography by acclaim-worthy Duke University historian Grant Wacker.
There was nothing spectacular or dazzling about Peter or John. They were common, first-century fishermen turned disciples. Nonetheless, what they gave to a man lame from the womb was beyond value or measure.
Children in their Sunday best were clutching on beautifully intertwined palm arrangements as they packed into the church compound that also includes the Ahliya School.
My path to Yale seemed destined, but crisis came quickly. Shortly after arriving at Yale, I faced accusations that landed me in a New Haven jail, and extradition to Florida. The accusations were found to be false, and the incident was scrubbed from my legal record.
Either you are a prix fixe Christian, taking everything on the bible menu, or you are a Christian who believes that passages cannot be taken literally, and often are not what they seem.
Each day of this Passover holiday I've posted a gourmet way for Jews to honor the commandment to eat matzah, aka \the bread of affliction\

I am proud that my church was one of the first to express concern and take action. And I'm happy the legislature and governor listened to us and changed the law.
For years I'd written off my conservative sisters and brothers in Christ until I spent time with them and saw the humans behind the labels. It led me to empathize with them as people even if I didn't agree with them on issues.
Whatever Jesus was, God or prophet, I thank him so much for acknowledging the big questions

Until mid-June, you'll be able to see some of the greatest sculpture in the world on exhibit here in the U.S. The work is on loan from Florence Cathedral, now on view at the Museum of Biblical Art in New York City.

The sun comes up slowly on the banks of Louisiana's bayou's. Lazy mornings mark the arrival of day even as moss covered trees swing sweetly in the hot and steamy breeze.
The source of my aggravation? The casual assumption that there is a \Christian\ position on the issue of sexual orientation and gender identity, an uncontroversial point of doctrine that all Christians share in common.
The best way to minimize political confrontations between church and state is to reduce government restraints on religion. Christians have no unified view of politics, and that is as true in China as in America. But believers everywhere agree on the importance of being allowed to worship God.

Passover is the holiday of getting unstuck. The Israelites lived in slavery for hundreds of years in Egypt, completed dominated by Pharoah and his regime. But the message of the biblical Exodus is that what is, now, does not have to be what is in the future.
Individuals and groups discriminating based off perceived threats to their religious freedoms due to the lifestyle and beliefs of others signal a return to a period in human history where prejudice, hatred and violence reigned supreme.
The final episode focuses on Mary Magdalene. According to the Gospels, she was a faithful follower of Jesus, but might she have been more than that -- perhaps even a lover, or Jesus' wife? Inquiring minds want to know.
The Muslim World is unhealthy in body, spirit and mind. We need to revive and reform left, right and center. Western criticism must be treated as informative but not instructive of Muslim initiatives for reform.
Can contemplation help us not only grow spiritually, but become more effective in our life skills as well?
We are blessed to live in a country that was founded on the principles of \all men are created equal\ and the universal rights of \life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\ However, one may live in a free country and still be enslaved.

It's this invitation to resurrection peace that pushes me. It challenges me to confront my fears, and sends me into the world on the mission to welcome God's reign of peace and nonviolence. That mission has taken me into the war zones of the world.
As Christians all over the world mark one of the holiest days of their religious calendar, the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding (FFEU) and the Nusantara Foundation applaud efforts toward communication, reconciliation and cooperation among all faiths.

I am a Christian. I curse...a lot. I have tattoos. I believe in the power of love and connection. I believe in the Universe. I am afraid and brave all of the time. I doubt and question a lot.
Rather than fight the matzah, I'm going to lean in to it, as it were. Every day of the holiday I'll post a gourmet way to honor the commandment to eat matzah
They thought Jesus was seen in the pizza parlor in Indiana this week; martyred for religious freedom, as a store was \forced\ to close after speaking words of hate in the guise of freedom.
One day in ancient Egypt, a Jewish family had a baby named Moses, around the same time a Druzish family had a daughter named Zipporah. Zipporah grew up healthy and beautiful,  but Egyptians enjoyed killing Jewish babies like Moses, and Pharaoh had ordered midwives to stop helping Jewish women give birth.
Our churches must challenge our ignorance, faulty theology and lack of historical knowledge of what our world was like twenty centuries ago in order to radically reorient our religion away from anti-Semitism.
Sometimes, words seem woefully inadequate. Take Easter, for example. Sunday morning thousands of pastors, priests, and country preachers will stand before their congregations and say, \Christ is risen.\
Approximately two million Children of Israel are now encamped in the Sinai following their extraordinary exodus from Egypt yesterday. Just days ago, they were slaves to Pharaoh. Today, they are free men and women, destined for self-determination in a land of their own.
This Sunday, I will go to church, have a big family dinner and break my Lenten fast. Next Sunday, I will go to church, have a big family dinner and break my Lenten fast all over again.
Instead, back to Alcabes' question, \Is healing important?\ which we might extend to ask
When I tuned in on March 29, 2015, for the National Geographic's film production Killing Jesus, adapted from Bill O'Reilly's book Killing Jesus, I was poised, pen in hand, to write about the return of Jesus the Tea Party guy.
The power and significance of Christ's death on the cross provides the opportunity for us to take pause. Although the story may be familiar, it is no less powerful year by year as we commemorate the most precious gift of Christ's sacrifice.

Shfokh hamatkha reminds me to pay attention to the hate that exists in the world, against us, and against others, but because it is said as we open the door for Elijah, it reminds me not to let the fear that hate evokes cloud our vision of what we are called to do to redeem the world.
As a university professor of pre-service teacher education students, I raise the distinction between moral convictions and professional ethics when we discuss issues of controversy within the field of education.
Today, I passed as straight. Sometimes, no matter how hard I try to not have it be a thing, being queer is a thing. It's a truism of coming out that some of us don't \look\ queer, and that means we have to come out more often, because otherwise no one will know.
Jesus has gone; he couldn't save Judas, and he won't intercede for David Biro. But we are here. We can turn around and look for them, these young people whose crimes condemned them forever. We can go back for them.
Following Lincoln's death, New York became the nation's center for enshrining Lincoln's legacy for the ages. It is, for that reason, particularly fitting that Lincoln and the Jews be on view at New-York Historical during this year's 150th anniversary of his assassination.
This past week, I joined 11 other medical students from the University of Chicago in volunteering at a Lakota Native American reservation in South Dakota. The experience was a great opportunity to not only learn about health care challenges on reservations, but also to reflect on the intersections between religion, service, and medicine.
Women of faith are increasingly seeking to elect those who commit to the betterment of women's lives and recognition of our contributions, cherished freedoms and autonomy.
When the movie ended, I was filled with emotion. I did not have any expectations of the film. I had assumed it would be like most religious films complete with a full white cast. Instead it was the most diverse looking religious film that I have ever seen.
We must, thus, restore Indiana and other states contemplating similar legislation to a path of understanding and support for people different from ourselves. We must work to rescind Indian's \Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\
The choice of mercy, of forgiveness, is anathema to my sense of manhood and my obligation for revenge and justice; but what would come of such forgiveness, besides a rejection of cultural and institutionalized violence and loss of personal pride, if I had the courage to enact it?
While Evans migration away from this kind of Evangelism is not news (rather, it is evidence of a strong advertising campaign that has painted her as a misunderstood victim), it is deeply disappointing that mainstream religious news sources and left-of-center bloggers have focused on her.
Harry's death by the dark lord is his salvation. As the devil rejoiced over the crucifixion of Christ, so too Voldemort glories in Harry's demise not realizing it is his own destruction that has been orchestrated.
One author gravitated toward talking about trust, another toward courage, a third wanted to focus on doubt, and a fourth wanted to focus on community. And then they asked if I'd talk about humor.



My daughter shared quite an extraordinary experience ... \Mommy!  Guess what happened last night?  I saw three ANGELS!!!\ Angels.  My baby saw angels.

Although he has seemed a bit out of step since his sponsor, Benedict, was replaced by the more humble Francis I, Dolan has insisted that he has made no effort to change his style or practice.

I believe the two most basic religious questions are
We are a stronger country when religious organizations of all faiths live up to our values--when we are welcoming, diverse, moral, and respect one another.

One of my lasting memories from college is celebrating Passover with Chelsea Clinton. We shared the Passover meal with several friends, and during it I asked her if she had ever celebrated Passover.
Francis is not a scientist either, but that has not stopped him from leaning on something very close to scientific consensus and speaking confidently about global warming as a reality with dire moral implications -- especially for the poor and vulnerable.

Robertson's words are ugly and ignorant, and the organizers, and all those who applauded him at the Prayer Breakfast in Vero Beach should be ashamed of themselves.

For those who know C.S. Lewis as the author of the Chronicles of Narnia books, it may be a surprise that the he became famous for his wartime radio addresses to the British people during WWII.


Instead of Luke's crucifixion, in the end it is Vader that dies. But before his death, like the robber crucified next to Christ, Vader seeks redemption from his son and encourages him to overcome the emperor and the dark side.
What we need at this point are politicians who have the intellectual and moral courage to move beyond questions such as \Is ISIS Islamic?\ and who can recognize this question for what it is - a thinly veiled form of Islamophobia intended to heighten our fears of Islam.
While some scholars question James' being the author of the epistle bearing his name in the New Testament, those five chapters associated with the brother of the Lord offer a rich sense of Jewish wisdom as how to make sense of suffering, how to walk in faith, and how to care for the poor.
I'd barely thought about high school since I got my diploma in the mail after endless summer school. I left home so fast I forgot to leave a forwarding address.
In America, we are not all Christian. We are Jews, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, atheists, secular humanists, and so much more. Public schools should be a place to learn about many faiths instead of just one.

Do you want to know the real meaning of Passover? Okay. Then let's start by asking, who was Pharaoh? What made him such an important villain?

Carrying water is not only hard work; it is dangerous work as well. A woman walking miles through the rural African bush alone isn't safe. So, women are exposed to violence and shame, which limits their possibilities for education, marriage, better health and other prospects.






What many do not know is that we do in fact have an unquestionably authentic burial shroud from a tomb in Jerusalem that has been carbon dated to the 1st century. Any consideration of the \Shroud of Turin\ should begin with a comparison of what we know rather than what we might want to believe.


In defeat, there is a tendency to close down and be judgmental. When we get down on ourselves, it is easy to forget that the Divine is continually rooting for us to get back up and make the most out of the next opportunity to move forward.
When religious leaders convince folks that the world is coming to an end during their lifetime, people adopt a sense of fatalism that is enormously destructive because it breeds inaction towards some of the biggest issues of our time.
Indeed, I had to deny myself my earthly desires, my earthly wants, and take up the \Preaching Elder Cross\ and follow Jesus, whom I had already loved, and who wished to call me to this service using the spiritual gifts he gave me.
The reason I am against the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is not because I am a lefty liberal, but because I am a proud American Christian. This legislation, though guised in the cloak of religious liberty, is the first string to be pulled out of our basic civil rights. This state is beginning the slippery slope of legalized discrimination.
I am now in in college and have been able to reflect on my experiences following 9/11. It is not the first time that the actions of a few have caused a whole demographic to be painted with a single brush and it is most definitely not the last.
Perhaps he was a bit of both. Clearly, his primary association among the canonical Gospels is that of being a traitor, although the \handing over\ of Jesus to the authorities is not necessarily to be rendered as a \betrayal\ in the Greek.

Lent, in the Christian tradition, is a 40-day period of fasting, prayer, penitence, and self-denial beginning with Ash Wednesday, leading to Easter. Thankfully, this season affords me the opportunity to give up three burdens for Lent, and I pray, forever
Male voices dominate many discussions about religion so two realities can be overlooked

Family was a huge part of Razan, Yusor, and Deah's life, and I know that respecting the wishes of their families was what they wanted. Farris Barakat, Deah's big brother, posted

In the name of progress and compromise, we may be setting ourselves up to be pawns in a global strategy of placing religious rights over all other constitutional and civil liberties.
With the second anniversary of Pope Francis on March 13, I was thinking about how one person has been able to inspire and unite so many people in such a short time, but not without some controversy. His early comment, \who am I to judge\, certainly got it all going. This reminded me about the life of St. Patrick and the tolerance of the Irish.




Users can share photos they've already taken, and either tag a scripture that came to mind when taking the picture, or search for a scripture to match what they captured on camera. Over time, much of the Bible will have pictures attached in display of individual and artistic interpretations.
\Onstage and screen, Nimoy leaves an extraordinary legacy of a bold and brilliant cutting-edge explorer of unimpeachable integrity. His inner conviction is manifest. En toto, a man for all seasons, for sure. May his memory be blessed.\
Muslims were indeed here from the beginning, but the beliefs and practices they brought with them only rarely endured. Their experiences serve as a reminder that every faith woven into the fabric of our country has been made up of strands both light and dark.

One must choose to be a feminist. It is a political and spiritual choice that must be made in the full knowledge of the forces that you are up against. What truly separates feminists from the majority of the students that I teach and most of the people in congregations I have met is the issue of confrontation and advocacy.


My theological writings arise from my personal journey through faith and doubt, difficulties and joys. Many of our encounters with God inform our theology, make us who we are, and shape our living. I position my writings to reflect this part of my life that I try to live out as faithfully as I can.
Inasmuch as President Obama has been more than clear about his Christian commitments, continuing to question his faith is merely a more socially acceptable way of calling him a liar.
Transhumanism is not a religion, nor is it in competition with religion. It is simply a mode of being that embraces evolving the human being with science, reason, and technology.
In reflecting on what Selma meant to me personally (as a white child, watching the Civil Rights movement from the safety of my living room -- as a child who would grow up to be a feminist and a lesbian), I realized that I grew up in an era that taught me that injustice is intolerable.
Designing synagogues is not exactly a growth industry--quite the opposite--but designer/architect Michael Landau has been doing it for 40 years, and isn't showing signs of slowing down.


Michael Shermer thinks so. Shermer is the editor of Skeptic magazine, and has long been a strong advocate for science and rational thinking, since they are the best ways we have for understanding the way the world works.
I wonder if Christians and/or we good people have love and kindness, generosity and goodness equal in passion to hatred and anger. The terrorist or murderer believes that any deed is justified in the name of the cause or the god s/he worships. There is no ambiguity.

Recently, I wrote pieces asking God to forgive us for our lack of empathy, compassion and grief over the loss of those who are \other\ than us while claiming to be faithful followers of Jesus.
If the Supreme Court imposes stringent notice requirements on job applicants and employees, it will set the clock back on religious rights in the workplace by decades. Employers will be able to duck their heads into the sand any time a visibly religious Sikh, Muslim or Jew walks in.
I don't understand how some of us think we have the right to separate ourselves from the world, but we do.  I get that maybe you don't want the worldly things to infiltrate your existence, but the truth is -- they WILL.
Last week, I wrote a blog post about Kelly Gissendaner's life and I'll admit that when I wrote the post I felt somewhat hopeless. I didn't think that changing the story would do much to save Kelly. I didn't think there was much we could do. But then yesterday I learned something.


Convicted for her part in the 1997 murder of her husband, Kelly enrolled in and graduated from the Certificate in Theological Studies program at Arrendale State Prison for Women. Through this program, she grew into a new person with purpose and hope. She experienced forgiveness and gained confidence through grace and redemption.





The particular incident I am referring to is Jesus being tempted in the wilderness by Satan for forty days, related to us in Matthew 4:1-2, Mark 1:12-13, and Luke 4:1-2.
Here we are at the beginning of another presidential campaign, and like every campaign since our founding, the people who put themselves forward as possible leaders of the free world are being grilled by the media on a number of issues.
There is a part of the soul that stirs at night, in the dark and soundless times of day, when our defenses are down and our daylight distractions no longer serve to protect us from ourselves.
Have you met Kelly? Not the mug shot that is in every news article, not the \first woman in 70 years to be executed in Georgia,\ not the woman who you might think ordered too much food for her last meal. I'm talking about Kelly Gissendaner, child of God, sinner saved by grace, a minister who was known for sharing Christ's love with both prisoners and prison guards.
We are historically and pathologically obligated to replay the dramas of the Spartans and Greeks against the \other.\ Feeling superior, we are free to disrespect their ways to sustain our own.
None amongst us is without sin; a few among us tend to misuse the power of religion on the minds of the followers. The problem was not with the religion, it was with the ones who did not get their religion right.

In the Balkans, Serbia conducted \ethnic cleansing\ -- a repellent euphemism for \ethnic purging.\  The \Islamic State\ is bent on \theological cleansing,\ which amounts to the same evil impulse.
Amid the ashes of World War II, with the stench of industrial-scale genocide in their nostrils, the nations of the world pledged to do better. They signed onto the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The Prophet's message was one of tolerance and diversity. It is hard to argue that the Saudi royal family has ever followed in his path or walked in his footsteps.
While we shouldn't wait until February to celebrate Black leaders, Black History Month gives us an opportunity to recognize how we fall short the rest of the year (and take steps towards correcting it). These leaders are each changing the face of global Christianity, and it has been a real privilege knowing them.
If religious leaders are to help influence society to live harmoniously, they will have to take courage and learn this 'new' way, or they can sit back and know they are probably not meeting their full potential.
Muslim Americans will tell us how we can best be their allies. We don't need to enter into the debate on the true nature of their religion. Rather, we should stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Muslim friends as they work out what they believe is \very Islamic\ today.
Here are five admittedly idealistic factors for religious Americans, and all who operate from a well-formed ethical base, to bear in mind as they engage the upcoming presidential election.
As an ordained minister of a small Lutheran congregation, I am uniquely committed to the social and religious institution of marriage and the role it plays in raising children and in providing life-long companionship.
I'm intrigued by the fact that, in spite of my explanation that this project is more about delving into who we are and what we do than about what we think or believe, many people are eager to distill the \Jesus journey\ down to making a specific set of claims for beliefs, end of story.

Depressed, weary, or frightened by stories of USIS and ISIS and other horrors, plus by debates over \religious extremism\ and the role of Islam, we focus instead on the not-unimportant figure of Pope Francis, who makes news and inspires reflection.
If in fact groups like ISIS are the true face of Islam, and if the propaganda that Muslim Americans engage in \stealth Jihad\ to take over the country is true, why should my neighbor not look at me with suspicion and disgust?
What's your story? That is a question that I am constantly asked and it use to annoy me. Somewhere along the way I embraced the fact that I am unique.
Sitting around arm and arm with my siblings, aunts and mother eight years ago as my dad struggled for each breath is a moment in my life I will never forget.
If Malcolm were alive today he would be able to look at the incidents of hate, fear and violence towards Arab Muslims in places such as Chicago's Southwest Suburbs since 9/11 and during the last two weeks and say, \I told you so!\
It's a beautiful answer, completely true, but it doesn't help when you are older. When we see what goes on in the world, we often ask ourselves the very same question, \Where is God?\
What inspired me was a rather realistic balancing of hope and prophecy and a grounded appreciation that complex realities are involved, first at the political and intellectual levels, and second, where it matters most, with the myriad communities where poverty and sharing are not abstractions but a daily challenge.


This month we're joined by award-winning playwright, journalist, and humorist Wajahat Ali for a far-ranging conversation that starts with a lengthy discussion about the recent tragic shooting of three Muslim college students in Chapel Hill, NC.
All my life I've been driven by an insatiable urge to know things -- things that have always been simply dismissed as \mysteries\. I displayed early symptoms of this sociological defect when, even as a small child, the plain facts were never quite enough to thrill me.
I am not suggesting that we just suppose that everyone around us can be trusted and we need not worry about our personal safety or the security of personal belongings. But I do propose giving up the practice of focusing on the faults of other people and, instead, looking for their good qualities.
Four out of five Americans claim to be Christians. That's more than a quarter billion people in the United states alone who claim, in one way or another, to follow Jesus. But what does that really mean?


Imagine for a moment that you are a teenager, arriving at college for your first year, and that you come from an interfaith family. Perhaps you were raised in one religion, but now, you feel drawn to explore the other religion.
There is a certain voicelessness that I associate with my experience in Catholicism--sure, I can talk about gay rights, premarital sex or saving the environment, but I am often met with a dismissive response or the assumption that I'm going through a progressive phase.

Ash Wednesday, is the day that Christians begin the season of Lent. It is a sacrificial, introspective, penitent and prayerful time, as we prepare to go to the cross with Jesus, and be resurrected with Him on Easter Sunday.

The main reason I resist it is that I reject the very premise of the holiday
Yale, a place that started out as a training ground for Congregationalist ministers (whose students included none other than Jonathan Edwards) retains to this day a dazzling array of religious treasures and relics, all publicly available.
This is my first fully public statement criticizing a sitting Israeli government official. This statement comes after careful consideration because I am heartbroken about the current state of affairs. Like an increasing number of American Jews, I want to make it clear that Netanyahu does not speak for me.

We all know that solving the problem of pain and suffering is, among other things, intellectually excruciating.
In memory of Leelah and our loved ones who have died, and in honor of Susan and those who come out each day as a transgender person, let's try to treat people of all genders, no genders, multiple genders and of various gender expressions as fully human and made in God's image.
I'm nearly 40 years into this mindfulness discipline.  But every time I return to it, day after day, I'm a beginner.  Every time I do the practice, I start like Kai, with my head stuck in a jug.
Deah, Yusor and Razan spent a significant part of their lives responding to a burning question read this week in the Book of Exodus (Mishpatim).  This question arises in an unexpected place, an enumeration of laws of civil behavior that is explicitly concerned with not favoring any party in a dispute or legal proceeding.
When Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was in London last week attempting to look presidential, he refused to answer even the most basic of policy questions.  Although he certainly didn't intend it this way, his non-answer to the query asking about his opinion of the theory of evolution should be long remembered.












The murder victims in Chapel Hill have been described as students, family members, Muslims, and Syrian, and the accused murderer as an atheist, anti-theist, white male, and terrorist.

Lord have mercy on the Christian mother and the atheist father who are not able to enter into the emotions of a Muslim Father and Mother whose children were snatched from them too soon.
Professor\u00a0Jonathan Haidt has noted, our brains are\u00a0able to justify almost any belief we have, and convince ourselves that we are \acting reasonably.\ And reason alone doesn't lead to morality.
Accompanying others selflessly is not the result of a state of enlightenment, nor is it a constant, deep emotion. It is a decision we make, a path we undertake consciously and with perseverance.
The museum, based in Jerusalem, has amassed a collection of more than 100 cuneiform tablets, original documents from the Judean community, which are now on display to the public for the first time.

For five years, I have chosen a few words from the bible to help encourage entrepreneurs as well as myself. It is a blessing to be able to share these words with so many around the world. It's important to remember that \we are God's hands.\


One of my friends once brought it to my attention that children ask all of their toughest questions in the car. They wait until you are most distracted and, of course, caged in a vehicle, to ambush you.
Baillie, Balthasar, Barth, Berdyaev, Bonhoeffer, Brunner, Bultmann--to mention only the \B-team,\ were coin-of-the-realm giants in the mid-20th century theological revival.
Taking everything into consideration, the Bible was written mostly by losers for the benefit of other losers. That's not a value judgment, just an observation. Think about it.




The interfaith movement is a rich mosaic of efforts, ranging from theological discourse to practical coalitions. Some interreligious harmony work is built on ethereal, ethical, and theological foundations.


I wrote this article to be a playlist/guide for the gospel categories of the Grammys, I won't attempt to make any \scientifically informed\ predictions of winners or losers but I can say who I am rooting for.

Sounds are also not a cultural universal


A disease wiped out has returned because of choices that put the nation's health in jeopardy.  More responsible choices are demanded.


As an interfaith child, and an interfaith parent, I have often faced the argument that Judaism has always prohibited intermarriage. As we enter yet another period of extensive interfaith marriage in the Jewish community, Strange Wives asks us to study, and remember, this part of our past.
It is true that there are verses in the Quran in which violence is permitted. Islamic fundamentalists have given such verses a central role in how they interpret the Quran, practically marginalizing the rest. But, enlightened Muslims reject such hermeneutics.
I have never had the privilege of a faith community catered to my cultural background. Although born to a Taiwanese family, I was exposed to a western education (at age 10); far too young to relate to local Taiwanese children.
Last week, a group of Muslim women launched a new Women's Mosque of America project in Los Angeles and held its first women-only Friday congregational prayer.
Our perception of the world is horribly off because the scale we use to measure ourselves is skewed and it will never be stacked in our favor unless there is a radical transformation. And that transformation does not exist outside of an encounter with Jesus.

Whether or not, you are a fan of the game, the shocking ending of Sunday's Super Bowl offers a refreshing outlook on life.
Hanif established Muslimat An-Nisaa in 1987 to help Muslim women and children access health, education and well-being services that were otherwise unattainable. Soon, she began providing shelter services as well, to those who needed it.
The word God doesn't refer to God
Early August would be \Revival Time\ in the rural Baptist churches in Georgia that my father pastored witnessing some of the greatest evangelical preachers locally and nationally.





Let's not mix religion and politics. We need gifted leadership in both government and religion.  I strongly recommend that the individual members of our Mainline Protestant churches dedicate themselves to becoming the talented and ethical political leaders our country and the world so badly need.

For my money, I don't think the desire for transcendence is going away. But I do wonder if students will bet their lives that the answer for this search lies beyond our world.
Last Chance Harvey reminds us that it is never too late to find love, never too late to begin again, never too late to shift one's priorities. Kate and Harvey are role models of love developing out of honest conversation as well as physical attraction. Kate and Harvey meet in the mind and in the heart.
Whether it's a personal, health, financial problem, or an actual storm, we all face times when we can feel so buried by our circumstances that solutions seem illusive.


As an understandable consequence of the unknowable providence of death, the inevitability of it provides a myriad of spiritual and moral opportunities for us to learn and reflect.

In their unending capacity to give and receive love, persons with Alzheimer's reveal to us the truth about what it means to be a human being.
Today, the \cry of despair\ has passed into the forgotten, and the \warning\ is no longer heard. In Europe, and in France especially, anti-Semitic acts and phrases propagate like a virus.

The adhan can help us recall what gives our lives meaning, and can help us cultivate an attitude of gratefulness. It can help us look up from the cellphone in our hand and notice the blue sky, the purple shadows stretching across the snow or the smiles of those we pass by.
Though I had said Kaddish for my father's father at Bergen Belsen, where I had always assumed he died because my father and his sister had been prisoners there, I discovered that he had actually been a prisoner at Auschwitz. Why had my father never told me?

Can the Charlie Hebdo tragedy which killed 17 men serve as a catalyst, in forging new and positive frontiers between Islam and the Western world?










In a time where opinions around sexual thoughts and feelings are getting more and more extreme the introduction of this new podcast is a welcome step in the right direction. God commands humanity to be fruitful and multiply.

The Vedic tradition already had influenced America indirectly through Emerson and other Transcendentalists.  But with Vivekananda, Americans got a look at an impressive embodiment of the tradition.


God doesn't intervene, not because he fails to recognize an atrocity for what it is, and not because he doesn't love us enough to intervene, but because he knows that nonintervention is the lesser of two evils.


I condemn the attack against Charlie, but that won't prevent me from speaking out against the subsequent, misguided attacks on Mosques or the #KillAllMuslims trending hashtag.

If you are planning on being atheist in the Middle East best be careful not to draw too much attention, especially online.

Every MLK Day, the Reverend Doctor's sage wisdom and booming voice seem like echoes of a past farther and farther away. Had he somehow escaped assassins' bullets, I can imagine him grey and dignified, bringing his prophetic wisdom to today's crises. More than ever, we could use his help to remember how to live together.



In a world that considers cathedrals of stone and even the pulpit where Dr. King spoke irrelevant, what is the future of the church?  We must come out of our pulpits and into the streets, into the gaps of broken relationship and broken trust.  We must do the hard and beautiful work of building the beloved community.


With apparently religiously motivated murders spilling innocent blood across our news screens this past week come serious concerns about the role of religion in our world.  And when fear rules the day, increased violence is never far behind.

We invite our colleagues -- presidents, deans and leaders of all divinity and theological schools -- to arise from the embers of silence and speak up and speak out as the prophet of old, \let justice run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream\ (Amos 5:24).

If I'm not on one side, this doesn't mean that I'm with the other. I'm neither on the side of those media that insult my faith and beliefs and spread lies, nor the side of violent criminals who insult my faith and beliefs, and spread lies.
It's not enough to keep telling non-Muslims, \Don't judge us by those few creeps.\ Muslims have to turn now and address those few creeps, those false guardians of the faith, with one simple declaration




Unfortunately, with the world still reeling from the horrific attacks in France that left twelve innocent people dead, anti-theists have jumped on the opportunity to continue their anti-Islam onslaught.
That metal taste in my mouth is back, a nauseating combination of rage, shame and fear. It's been years since I have tasted it -- perhaps not since the last time someone drew a swastika on the whiteboard hanging on my dorm room door.
Make no mistake, there truly are ghosts in Mississippi. Most often, they inhabit long forgotten places and toil with hopes that their mortal lives have not been lived in vain.  A few years ago, I first traveled to a forgotten place to meet a forgotten man.
We don't want to talk about race and religion because it might get awkward. We don't want to talk about sex because we might say the wrong thing. We can't speak about gay marriage and climate change because we're afraid of offending someone or sounding too open- or closed-minded. So we talk about work or complain or rave about the latest iPhone.
Wails, whimpers, and screams filled the large hall for several minutes, until Matthew asked us to very gently sit up and to start toning together. Our voices united in the most soothing, healing sound of harmony. As it filled my entire being, I felt the the intensity of my emotion gradually subside.
What can we do against an enemy with no moral compass? I'm afraid we must expose them as the murderers they are. And how can we do that? Short term, we can unite in our opposition to their behavior, we can punish the people who fund them, and we can rise in defense of those whom they most brutally oppress.
We will soon be entering our field as young and idealistic rabbis. The pope, MLK and Moses serve as some of our role models for this type of spiritual activism. In order for religion to be relevant to our time, it is upon us to leave the confines of the synagogue and enact the change we wish to see.
The people who devastated Charlie Hebdo may have thought, as they fled French justice, that they won a victory for Islam.  But the effect of their action is the opposite -- they have contributed powerfully to fear of Muslims.
God placed humans in the Garden of Eden and gave them the right to agree or disagree.  One of the primary ways that we express agreement or disagreement is through speech.  The most divine thing that we do on any given day is express who we are and what we believe.
During the Middle Ages maps of the world often placed Jerusalem at the center. This was based on the vulgate, the Latin, translation of Ezekiel 5:5 which Jerome understood to mean Jerusalem as terrae umbilicus, the \navel of the earth.\
The Mosque of Rome is the largest Mosque of Europe and its architecture replicates and perfectly integrates itself in the heart of Italy.
A report came out reflecting just some of the terrible ways our government agencies and military arms treat human beings. There was silence, or even defense of such actions.



Freedom of expression does not mean that anyone has the right to be heard at any time and in any forum, no matter what.  There are times when lines must be drawn for reasons both moral and legal, but there are other times when it is inappropriate and wrong to draw such lines.
I don't want anyone to ever believe that just because a certain individual has access to a Twitter account it means that she is a spokesperson for the Christian faith. Mocking people of other faith traditions is not Christian. Neither is it Christian to worship the gun culture in America that has done so much damage to our society.

I got over my acolyte envy; Cardinal Burke and his ilk need to get over their aversion to women.  All of us in leadership roles for the Church and its institutions need to come together to figure out how to sustain the service enterprises that are the collective ministry of the Church in the world.  Now THAT is a topic for a Synod where women truly should be heard!

We are two American religious communities in such pain from the outburst of extremist violence in France that we not only have forgotten each other. We have forgotten ourselves.
My outrage will not stem from my citizenship or my religious beliefs, but from the fact that I am a human being. No more, no less.



Religion today can be characterized by tension and fear, uncertainty and anxiety. As I cringe before the terrorist attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, I wonder if the question sometimes is not atheism versus religion, but the 21st century versus the dark ages.
Perhaps young Charlie and his hero, Marcus Mariota, are pointing a way forward toward a new \least of these\ theology for evangelicals -- rooted in orthopraxy -- some fifteen years into a new millennium. Let me explain.
To save humanity from tearing itself apart, we must reject the erroneous premise that some human beings have been created as less than others. We must accept as inviolable and \self-evident\ the truths that God is indeed compassionate and all-loving, and that all of us have been created equal.


The American Muslim community is incredibly diverse, ethnically, religiously, linguistically, ideologically, socially and economically. We begin in Michigan -- home to the nation's largest Muslim population.
What causes pain and grief in my soul is that there are those people deeply saddened and grieving over the loss of another unarmed black male to a white police officer; those able to enter into the grief and complexity of law enforcement.






In New York City, since protests began over the treatment of African-Americans caught up in the criminal justice system, the police union there has done everything possible to inflame tensions and undermine civil authority.
Germany's official focus on religion as a central factor in development strategy reflects a new willingness to explore and speak to the positive and negative roles that religious beliefs and institutions play in world affairs. Germany is not alone in this trend.

The problem with resolutions is that they propose a future state that will bring us the feelings we would wish to have. And what are those feelings? Well, if we achieved the intention of those resolutions, we would feel really good about who we are and where we are in our lives.




The morally problematic passages in the Constitution have been overturned by various amendments and laws; similarly, one should not criticize contemporary religions on the basis of problematic passages within their sacred texts, if those passages have been rejected or nullified.

If you'd asked me, when I was a comic book-loving Jewish girl coming of age in 60s Detroit, besotted with Batman and following Superman's every adventure, what I wanted to do when I grew up, I may well have described exactly what Steve Bergson does today.
I believe that the church is sick when it makes people who need treatment hide out of fear for their professional lives.





This November, I attended the first annual conference of the Sisterhood of Salaam Shalom. Afterwards, I posted on my Facebook page a picture of 100 Jewish and Muslim women--old and young; bareheaded, hijabi, and a few in yarmulkes.




That first Christmas was a precursor to the science-fiction convention used over and over again in Doctor Who, Star Trek and every \galaxy far, far away\ -- a \rip in the time-space continuum\ -- as infinity takes on finitude, as the creator of the stars embraces a body made of stardust. Flesh and blood, this earthy God.
The kind of worship needed in 2015 cannot happen in a mega church, or any church that is obsessed with church growth. It is participation in the life of a local church that is so rooted in a neighborhood that they become hospitable to those they would otherwise leave out.
Legally speaking, 2014 has not been a good year for secular Americans. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that closely held, for-profit corporations can claim religious exemptions from laws that go against their owners' religious beliefs.

Before embarking on the information modules, a philosophic overview of religious diversity training should be considered. There will be people who are skeptical, or hostile, to anything labeled as interfaith.
What will flow is a greater love and a more profound kindness that finally realizes it is the very same love and kindness awakening within me as a Jew or a Christian, as a Muslim, or a Hindu, or a Buddhist.
Those of us with privilege need to be vigilant about standing up for those who are marginalized and oppressed. Like Joseph we need to find our hidden voice and courageously speak out for freedom and justice for all.
Christian parents, Muslim parents, Jewish parents, you name it, they all face a time when they have to address what others believe, and the common response I found was that they just tell their children everyone else is wrong.


This is not a holiday story of a fancy Christmas dinner, gifts under a tree, or glee on my children's faces when they open their stockings. This is a story of getting comfortable with lack of control, which isn't exactly my strong suit.




You--we--can make a real difference in 2015 if we truly dedicate ourselves to becoming a united force of change by loving God and loving our neighbors as ourselves.  What kind of foundation does your house of life have?  Is it built on rock or sand?  What kind of a world do you (we) want?



Sufis generally get together for communal dinner every Saturday but during Ramadan when they fast, they get together four times a week to cook and gather for the Iftar meal that breaks the day-long fast. As both sisters are American, tonights dinner is not going to be ethnic.



Faith community leadership is increasingly critical as we also negotiate recent targeted acts of violence against law enforcement, such as Saturday's tragic shootings of NYPD Officers Ramos and Liu in Brooklyn.
So that's the first challenge\u00a0for the Jewish community when it comes to science -- while the Christian community grapples with\u00a0how\u00a0to embrace science, the Jewish community has to figure out how to relate to\u00a0Judaism.

When I found out about the Eric Garner decision, I did not know how to respond. But my first instinct was not to stop. It was to go and do something. And I surely didn't pause to find my favorite worship song or let alone ask, \Lord, what would you have me to do?\
Have you ever been enamored by a child's sense of wonder? Their incredulous awe in myths like the tooth fairy and Santa, their wide-eyed anticipation of unwrapping a present?
Have you ever wondered what it is like to be a shepherd? Most of the time you are bored out of your mind. I sit there and watch sheep day after day. I never wanted to be a shepherd.
I stand on both sides of the so-called \blue line,\ placing one foot in the world of the NYPD furious over the murder of two of our own and another foot in with the black and brown people of this city angry with the senseless deaths of young people at the hands of the police.
I don't like -- don't approve, refuse to throw myself into -- the spirit of obligatory gift-giving. In my lifetime, this has become existentially linked to a commercial orgy that has now even co-opted the ritual angle
This brief essay is bound to make no one happy. It is not meant to. Nor is it meant to place judgment on anyone's leaning regarding a very volatile political issue in American society.
While every year is filled with its triumphs and its terrors, 2014 has been a year that has felt particularly fraught. It is not because this is a year where evil and terror appeared from nowhere, surprising us in our general euphoria or mundane lives.
Now that the \War on Christmas\ is over -- its publicist, Fox News Bill O'Reilly, announced this finding last week -- we can survey the post-war terrain.
I'm ready to find the pony. But maybe I have to dig through a little more shit first. As some of my less pastoral friends and family put it, it could be worse. I could be dead. So I've got that going for me.
How many children has our greed killed?  How many children grow up without proper education?  How many children are subjected to the slow deaths of racism, homophobia and sexism?  How many children are dead because of our thirst for guns and violence?  The questions can go on and on.
I thank you for the Bloomington Police Department, and the Mall of America Security Force, for their willingness to keep things calm and peaceful.  May their humanity continue to shine in the difficult months ahead, as we work towards systemic change when police are accountable to the same laws as other citizens.
Instead of pitting the deaths of Liu and Ramos against Garner and Brown; we can join them together, understanding them as martyrs whose live inspire us on both sides of the blue line to work for a more just, safe and united America.
Just before Christmas the previous year, my mother (\Mimi\ to her grandchildren) had died in my childhood home in Savannah, Georgia.  For the first time in my life I had decided to spend Christmas away from my family of origin, away from Savannah.  It was not an uncomplicated decision, but I had made peace with it.


Rabbi Katy Allen teaches that Hanukkah is a time to rededicate ourselves to the holy and hard work of responding to climate change. She writes that we \increase our holiness by rededicating ourselves to reducing our carbon footprint.\
Joseph and Mary remind us that Christmas is a genuine love story--the story of God's unwavering love for us and our love for him; the marvelous love of a wife and a husband and the joyous wonder of a first child.


It is helpful to think about common misconceptions that people have about the Bible so that we can read it better.
Darkness filled the sky and night was upon me. Throughout my drive to the airport, I thought about the death of my grandmother. I was hurting.







This year we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI -- or the Great War -- in Europe. In the midst of this commemoration, we will do well to remember the remarkable Christmas Truce of 1914.
To tell women to pray at home, especially during the last ten nights of Ramadan, is dehumanizing.  I am not a houseplant or a goldfish to be left by the window.
The presence of sorrow doesn't mean that Christmastime, even with sadness mixed in, can't be truly joyous and happy. It just means we have to redefine our understanding of \happy\ and \joyful.\
Instead, the plight of the Palestinian Christian is very much connected to that of the Palestinian Muslim in that both experience injustices every day as a result of oppressive and discriminatory policies imposed on them by the Israeli Occupation.
Look, I'm not saying you can't be a Christian and support torture. I'm just saying that you're going to have a hard time convincing Jesus that it's a Christianity he would recognize.
I am successful when my students and conversation partners begin enclosing and confining these colonial categories in quotation marks, recognizing their construction and significance, historicizing them, disrupting them, and depriving them of their power.
It is fair to describe Pope Francis's summons as a call to Christian adulthood, but not in some superficial or trite sense.  Rather he expects all Catholics to show a spirit of leadership,  independence, and good judgment.

How do you evangelize? I do it by trying to reflect the characteristics of God. When I'm around people, I do what I think He would do
The ribbon was there every year to remind us that in spite of yule logs, spiced cider and jingle bells, something was still not quite right with the world.
Our advocates have our best interests in mind and don't accept verdicts such as failure or disease. They may take the form of friends or family, but they begin with the good thoughts that are always occurring to us from a uniquely divine source.
As passages such as Matthew 25 make abundantly clear, to love God is to find and serve Jesus in the form of the most vulnerable among us






Actually, we will never know the exact birth date of Jesus. But that really doesn't make any difference, for we know that Jesus was a real person who is still alive and is a very real presence in our lives today. Let us focus on that as we prepare for a blessed Christmas celebration.


The Civil Rights Movement was itself the fruit of the shared spiritual yearnings of blacks and Indians. Therefore, South Asian immigrants are under historical, moral and spiritual obligations to refuse offers of white privilege and join in solidarity with African-Americans.
After a few years outside the isolation of an Evangelical community, these are values I find most lacking in the mainstream and would pass on to others who are still building their own identities.


Torture is not merely an issue of political left or right. It is not just an issue of military opinion versus civilian. It is an issue that grows from the nature of man, from the principled vision of a nation and from the highest of religious truth.


Bale's Moses changes dramatically from a strapping, confident and commanding \prince of Egypt\ -- the typical hero of braun and bravado -- to a wan, confused, tormented, exhausted servant.
Tis the season of giving. Right? From \Giving Tuesday\ to Salvation Army bell ringers to frantic online donations or checks postmarked by Dec. 31, charitable giving spikes in December.
We have no way to ascertain whether Moses personally suffered from trauma. He lived long before history was written down in Israel and the stories about him are shrouded in centuries of later tradition.


In the Messiah the Jesus story begins with Israel's prophets. They anticipate the savior's arrival, which finds its fulfillment in the gospel stories. Israel's anticipation and Jesus as its fulfillment

Why isn't the Christian church, black and white together, rising up in one voice and demanding justice throughout the land?
As a campaigner for peace and pluralism, Ahmed is dismayed by the toxic lure of an Islamist doctrine that is supremacist, separatist, and hostile to secular Western values, and she calls for an urgent review of this ideology.
Because Muhammad spent his life fighting against everything ISIS stands for, and he would have loved Canada.
Fundamentalism pushes for conformity to their religious status quo, and that push is rarely seen by them for what it actually is
I knew why Bill wanted me to see this movie. He wanted me to see it because in the character he saw a figure living out the life that I have long sought to live. Now having seen the movie, I feel like I have a better chance of doing just that.
What can we do to make it through this season with wisdom and grace kicking out the guilt?
Astute diplomatic symbolism aside, the larger question is which Bhagavad Gita will prevail during the Modi Raj. The Prime Minister's personal background leads back to the Gita of RSS founder Hedgewar, who read the work as a conservative, exclusivist, Hindu work.
Worship leaders know that they have more precedents than those they inherit from, say, old Europe and old suburbs, and have to think fresh thoughts for tomorrow's buildings.

The significance of this mountain lies more in its religious significance. Brahmagiri is located only a few kilometers from Triambakeshwar, the source of the river Godavari, one of the major river systems of South India.
I realize there are those who have never experienced or tried to understand the relationship between God and mankind. Without judgment, each person must decide where their faith is, or isn't.




We must continue to breathe life into his story and case.  We must use the details of the horrific tragedy of Eric Garner's death to shock life into the people of this nation.  We must keep demanding justice.  Do not ever stop telling the story of Eric Garner.  Get out into the streets and breathe the breath of life into this dead, racist nation.
The truth is that Christmas Creep isn't just about forgetting other holidays, it's about forgetting other people. And worse than that, Christmas Creep is about forgetting Christmas as well.
For me, as a child in the mission, Christmas meant feeling guilty because Mom did so much and we mere mortals did so little. My childhood Yuletide question was
It's past time to fix it, and the church must stand alongside a new generation of young leaders and help the nation find the way forward.
For the sake of creation, for the sake of our sister and brothers, for the sake of the planet, and for own sake, is is important to work for justice and continue to fight to reverse climate change.
The book is A Short History of the Arab Peoples by Sir John Glubb, copyright 1969. This short volume of 300 pages is an executive summary of a four volume more detailed work by this author on the subject.



My 24-year-old daughter lives in Jerusalem. It's not a large city, so anything that happens in Jerusalem, is too close for comfort in this mother's eyes. I am not a staunch pro-Israel supporter, as many expect I might be. However, this was wrong on all levels. This is black and white for me
As a music journalist it may seem out of place to bring up the socio-political issues of the day.  But in the music that I have recently covered at the English Folk Expo, I found this song whose words and music stir me, and drove me to think about who we are and what we stand for as a species.



Is reconciliation possible between brothers or peoples who have been in conflict for a long time? The answer is yes, but it requires maturity, wisdom and courage.


Like a large family gathered around a bounteous autumn table keeping the peace by not telling the truth, many of us heard more truth from St. Louis County this week two nights ago than we were quite prepared to deal with.



Beyond the needless death of an 18-year-old, it would be further heartbreaking if Ferguson proved to be nothing more than a euphemism added to similar tragedies to recall when the next racially-charged event pricks otherwise apathetic souls into momentary reactionary anger for public consumption.

These lines are from ancient Jerusalem and form part of a psalm of thanksgiving that was penned in Hebrew over 2,000 years ago and preserved in the now-famous Dead Sea Scrolls. Though ancient, its themes resonate with modern religious traditions.
African American historians, womanists in particular, have long warned that \respectability\ is an elite ideology that encourages the marginalized to conform to sociocultural standards and mannerisms defined only by those in power.
I was with just elected Massachusetts Democratic Governor, Ed King, at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Boston's West End in January of 1979, as people sat quietly in the Church and heard Bishop Joseph McGuire ask for God's blessing on our new Governor.
The National Latino Evangelical Coalition is now committed to two things
No matter one's feelings about the interaction of religion and technology, religion is being pushed, cajoled, uplifted, and profoundly changed by the technological advances of our time and merits greater study.
Elections -- always rough and wearisome -- are now tawdry cartoons churned by gaudy ad agencies hired by lackluster political parties. And so it will remain unless the listless elephant arises.

Half of all Americans, including more than three-quarters of white evangelicals, believe the End Times are upon us! But, seeing as the clearest prophecy in the Bible, attributed to Jesus himself, went unfulfilled, maybe we need think harder.
Dear America, we greet you as Christians who believe that freedom in Christ means that all persons deserve respect and equality before God and the law.
The Constitution of 1973 clearly states equal and fair rights to all citizens of the Islamic republic of Pakistan. Why have we backtracked on the indubitable basis our country was founded upon? Where did tolerance go?




This is a globally disturbing historic moment when misguided Muslim extremists are murdering untold numbers of Christians, Muslims and anyone else they encounter and pitting the faiths against each other.  It is at such moments that the world's peacemakers, like Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, are needed more than ever.

Thanksgiving has been celebrated by Native Americans, Christians, Jews and whoever else wants to since 1621, and I firmly believe we should continue unapologetically to celebrate giving thanks to God Almighty for our many blessings.
Evidently using the Bible as a weapon of mass discrimination against LGBT people is fair game but suggesting that loving your neighbors by not deporting them is out of bounds. Honest to Ethel... they make my hair hurt.


Sometimes it is in these small moments and the regular observance of finding just one thing for which you're thankful that works together to create a grateful heart.
The twins, Jacob and Esav, grow up together then go their separate ways. But could things have been different?

God is not the God of Muslims and no where he claims that in Quran. He is creator of the universe(s), which is within and beyond our imagination. Quran is a book of guidance to preserve the cohesiveness within and what surrounds us; people and the environment.
I have seen examples of people ending a marriage only to realize later that they hadn't been so bad off after all. In the Church, discernment, listening to our hearts, and deep prayer and meditation, are all called for before entering into or ending such a union.

What did I believe in? It is still something I think about fairly often. If I had been raised strictly Jewish, what would be different about me and my outlook on the world?




When you walk through the Vatican Museums, one of the things that you likely won't notice on the way to the Sistine Chapel is a wall made of windows and large doors tucked behind a gift shop that have the seal of Pope Benedict XVI above them.


The Catholic Church at this moment in history is faced with a rising chorus of right-wing dissent. This movement poses a threat to Pope Francis's reforms, but the threat should not be overblown.
Last week His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama came to Princeton University and met with a select group of students to discuss part of the University's informal motto, \In the service of all nations.\

In the massive California State University system, as at some other universities, new anti-discrimination rules for student groups mean it can no longer be required that the president of the Christian student fellowship is Christian.

Sikhism and America share the fundamental principles of integrity, hard work, and service, and both seek to uphold righteousness in the face of injustice
Shalva Weil's characterization of \wannbe\ Jews is itself derogatory and dismissive. Those exploring their heritage or seeking to convert to Judaism should according to our tradition be treated with respect, even if they do not choose to complete their journey.
While the culture wars are usually attributed to the Christian right, the U.S. Catholic bishops are in many ways responsible for starting the culture wars that have polarized society and paralyzed our political process. Today, the Catholic bishops have a chance to back down from the culture wars they started. The question is

Awake
Last week, three hotly trending topics in my Facebook feed related to feminism. The first was about a video of a woman walking around Manhattan to much objectification. The second pertained to a voyeuristic rabbi who had installed cameras in a D.C. mikvah. The third was about another Orthodox rabbi who resigned from the RBC in light of the recent mikvah scandal.
Relying on a variety of polls that use a variety of methods and definitions, and, always ready to point to a few counter-trends, we've reported on those who track the religious or irreligious young through various cohorts or with various religious identities.


If we think our tradition demands we risk our children's lives by not accepting them, like Avraham, maybe we are misreading our tradition. God does not need our defense, and God will most certainly be there when we get back. All our children are angels who are just waiting to be welcomed into the tent.

I have been sought out by Christ in his strong covenant affection; I am his, and he is mine. In him I have been chosen and sealed until the day of redemption, when our love will become not a temporary but an eternal reality.



Listen to Elisabetta Piqu\u00e9 discuss her process and experience in writing Pope Francis's biography, Pope Francis

These young people, who demanded the civil rights, have somehow fifty years later become the people who support the restriction on voter rights.
It isn't just our homosexual \being\ that God \tolerates\ but our homosexual \doing\ -- our romantic, erotic, loving relationships -- that God creates, ordains, and declares good in Hebrew and Christian scriptures.

She looked the part of a fine arts major, with the gold spangle in her nostril, the streak of purple in her jet-black hair and her bespoke clothing. Her diminutive form gave no hint of the feisty energy that would pour forth whenever she spoke in the meetings of the Student Interfaith Council
As an American Jewish and an American Muslim leader dedicated to the principle that Muslims and Jews should stand up for each other whenever the rights of members of either community are violated anywhere in the world, we are speaking out together against the ever-intensifying campaign of intimidation against the Crimean Tatars.
Mishra's essay is an incredible exercise in distortion and denial. Even if one grants that there is a glimmer of good intentions around his apocalyptic vision the problem with the sheer fictiveness of his idea of India remains.
There are several 'news' sources that claim to be conservative that berate scholars. The majority of these verbal assaults are directed at ones that are involved in the field of religious studies.
We don't have to wait for a life review.  We can review our lives now including forgiving ourselves and others.  We can understand the connectedness to everyone and everything.  Everything done to others we are doing to ourselves.
Sectarian violence persists in Islam, and discredits the religion of Muhammad, Ali, and Husayn before the world.  There is much to ponder, this year, on Ashura.
This year, in our church's All Saints celebration, I lit a candle to my birth parents Ken and Sophia, to birth grandparents Clinton and Jessie, to Katie and John, my saints I'll never meet, but whose genes are the weft and warp in the tapestry that is me.



I have only known Harry Reicher for three months, and yet today I say goodbye to him as an old friend. I don't know why, but I wasn't expecting to meet a devout and practicing Jew the day he first walked into the USC Shoah Foundation office, but Harry's devotion to his religious life radiated from him the moment he said hello.



Far too many of us spend our time paddling around in the shallow things of life instead of heading straight for the deeps. We get tangled up on the sandbars of the shallow waters of life, dissipating our energies on the trivial. This is especially relevant now as people prepare to vote in the election of this coming Tuesday, November 4.


What if I looked at on this Reformation Day Oberman's critique in light of Halloween how would Luther speak today in that reclamation? What would a reclaimed Halloween express?
I returned from the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission convinced that it's only a matter of time before the SBC changes how it relates to the LGBT community. The question is whether that change will be a gentler spin on \love the sinner, hate the sin,\ a softer rhetoric toward some and a harsher one toward others, or the beginning of a deeper journey toward understanding.
Let's take a closer look (if we dare) at the inspiration for the cackling Halloween hag, the patroness of witches
One of the reasons Jesus got a bad reputation amongst the religious community of his day was because he was not afraid to associate himself with mankind, all of mankind

God's wrath, properly understood, makes the good news about King Jesus truly moving. That is, we must understand that the wrath of God is most definitely not divine wife-beating, however poetic Piper thinks such a sentiment to be (yikes).


Nobody grows old. You just wake up one day and realize you are. Dress up aging any way you wish. Offer whatever cute cliche' you'd like. None of it helps. Aging, or growing old, just plain sucks.
What can the American Jewish community, which has witnessed synagogues erode and disappear with alarming regularity in recent years, learn from past renaissances in order to empower us to engineer our own?
Evangelical anti-theism, much like militant theism by extremist clerics in the theist world, detaches one from the important values of objectivity and fairness.
When I look back on the suffering in my life, I see it now as a gift. I would have never asked for it for a second, I hated it while it was happening and I protested as loudly as I could, but suffering happened anyway. Now, in retrospect I see the way in which it deepened my being immeasurably.
Ethics, diversity, pluralism and excellence





One of the greatest challenges any Christian faces is the risk of falling in love with the idea of being like Jesus (WWJD?) while failing to recognize what a life lived in his footsteps truly looks like.

I want to talk about darkness. Not just the darkness that happens when the sun goes down and the lights go off -- I'm talking about the darkness that sometimes descends on our lives, making everything seem bleak and hopeless

And before people get up in arms about using this heinous crime to promote a feminist agenda -- I disagree (although each and every one of us promote agendas every day of our lives). I see it as an opportunity to unearth the worms and re-soil.
The question that older generations of leaders within mainline denominations must ask themselves, I suggested, therefore, is
In terms of God's justice, we may have moved too slow and too late but we kept moving. And it's taken us nearly 40 years. Forty years of steps forward and steps back. But we've kept on moving ... and after nearly 40 years in the wilderness I do believe we can see the Promised Land of full inclusion on the horizon.

The past few months and years, the church has become increasingly polarized on the LGBT debate. We have neglected to see the importance of what Jesus prayed. Our churches have become dysfunctional and our witness has diminished.
When did we give up being the nation that welcomed the wretched, tired and poor upon our teeming shores? Now we imagine they are terrorists armed with viruses.
Once upon a time, a mother made her son a wristband. On it was written
Many are no doubt disappointed at the seeming failure of the final relatio or report issued on Oct. 18th by the special synod or meeting of bishops that began in Rome beginning Oct. 5th.
Last Monday I was arrested in Ferguson, Missouri, along with dozens of other clergy, seminarians, and people of many faith traditions. As a white, middle-aged, married,  mother of three and a rule-abiding Presbyterian, this was a new experience for me.
Why go to church to hear about a zombie or get possessed by a ghost or drink blood? You can do pretty much the same thing down the street at the nearby Halloween party, and it'll be a lot more fun.
Perhaps you know his name from his book Jesus
A phenomenon of Mass mobs, where large groups of suburbanites worship in the city on a given Sunday, is shining new light for a day on urban parishes that are dwindling or, in some cases, have been closed.
Psalm 46 continually reminds us that the Reformation is not a celebration of identity but rather the deconstruction of walls, whether those walls be political, cultural, ethnic, economic or religious.





If you are extraordinarily upset or excited about the extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the family that has taken place for the last two weeks here in Rome, then you likely don't really understand what it actually is.
Surely there is a better way for Christian discourse than to resort to serious accusations of godlessness towards those who may have an alternative opinion, even if that opinion is in the minority.
To deepen and heal our relationships he guides us to say (to ourselves) as we sit with our loved ones, \Darling, I am here for you. Darling, I know you suffer, and I am here for you.\
Though I might not subscribe to every prayer in the Siddur, I always use the synagogue time for my own prayer of thanks for being alive and the multitudes of blessings I enjoy.  I want to let the Lord know I haven't forgotten them.  Then, leaving the hall, the yarmulke still in place on my head, I head home feeling a little purer.
Meet the Mormons is an 80-minute infomercial produced by The Church of Jesus Christ of LDS, highlighting a diverse cross-section of church members. It's well-made, but it feels more like a video Pfizer, Goldman Sachs or Exxon would put out about how great their corporation is than an actual documentary.
After the kind of year we had, who is really having a Simchat Torah, any kind of rejoicing with the Torah? The world has gone mad.

If we follow Christ like we follow the latest food phenomenons or workout routine (to say nothing of our obsession with material things), we would each lead much more meaningful and happy lives.
What do chaplains have to do with biological, viral threats?  Military and health care chaplains have generally been on the front lines in the critical care and urgent emergency medical response to these new infectious agents.
Animals are everywhere in the Christian Bible and yet the erasure of the nonhuman from theological contemplation has been commonplace from the earliest days of the church.
I didn't expect to be on a flight to Mexico. I thought I would spend most of today completing multiple unfinished writing projects that I have long neglected. Things changed when I met Ramon.

Ebola came to our church, even though no one was exposed to the virus inside our building. We encountered Ebola because one of our members came face-to-face with it. And to echo the words of the Apostle Paul, when one member of the body hurts, the entire body feels pain.




What Bill Maher, Sam Harris and many others like them fail to realize is that religion as it is practiced is a product of a wide array of factors, the official texts being only one of them. People of any faith are more shaped by the norms of their cultural context, interpreting their religious texts to comport with those norms rather than the other way around.
There is a Ferguson in every community across the country. You may not be able or compelled to make the trip to Ferguson, Missouri, but you can walk across the street





The bonds forged by interpersonal contact can last a lifetime, and hearing, in person, about the lived religion of an often-maligned group like American Muslims creates advocates for equality and dialogue. A lifetime of exposure to prejudicial narratives can be dispelled by one hour of personal contact.
The next time you leave your door unlocked and no one breaks in, the next time someone buys you a gift, or the next time someone does something nice for you, I'm not telling you not to thank God (if thanking God is what you do), I'm simply suggesting that people are also worthy of praise.
Political polarization is worse than ever this fall, with contests being framed as a struggle between virtue and vice, strength and weakness.
There is a saying of the Prophet, \There will come a time when holding firmly onto religion will be like holding onto hot coals (Al-Tirmidhi).\ Facing pressures both internal and external to Islam, it feels that time has come.
Unfortunately, the ignorance to Islam that Megyn Kelly demonstrated interfered with her ability to hold a rational and just interview. Indeed, what is fair and balanced about inviting an anonymous puppet and taking his word as gospel, without any countering voice?


Protecting the fundamental right to walk in the streets -- for black teenagers and for all Americans, of every stripe and kind -- is crucial to democracy.





In Pakistan, as the days to Eid-ul-Adha draw near, the craze of buying animals for sacrifice intensifies. Streets, lanes, alleys are filled by the young as well as the old bragging about the uniqueness of their animals, despite the stench of animal waste that lingers in the air.

As the clock ticks, the reasons for acting on climate change are becoming more urgent and obvious, and the religious community is increasingly stepping up to the challenge.
Crazy is not a bad word. Crazy people are not bad. So I'm reclaiming crazy in public discourse as a way to de-stigmatize mental illness. I stand on the shoulders of many others who repurpose words to empower people whose power has been taken away.

Growing up in a Buddhist family in Virginia in the '80s, I was often on the defensive about my family's beliefs. It was not unusual to be shunned by other kids because I did not believe in God the same way they'd been taught in church.
Look at the lengths to which people have gone to force their version of reality onto others in the name of this thing we call God. Think about all the religious wars that have taken place in human history, the degree to which we have made each other suffer because we find it unacceptable that two different versions of the same thing can exist.
Lately, I have come to believe the power to forgive is always mine. Exercising that power makes me stronger, not weaker. It definitely makes me happier. Why on Earth would I want to hold on to the pain of hating someone for something that happened 30 years ago?

In a recent New York Times op-ed, evolutionary biologist David Barash recounts telling the undergraduates in his animal behavior class that evolutionary science has \demolished two previously potent pillars of religious faith and undermined belief in an omnipotent and omni-benevolent God.\ Barash's claims of demolition are more \op\ than \ed,\ I'm afraid.

The White House has acknowledged for the first time that the strict standards President Obama imposed last year to prevent civilian deaths from U.S. drone strikes will not apply to U.S. military operations in Syria and Iraq. This is a tragic error.

A few days ago, eight faculty members at the General Theological Seminary in New York went on strike until their one demand was met. What was that demand? A meeting. As of this morning, they have all been fired.

No doubt, it is our natural instincts as parents to protect our kids from any harm. To watch them suffer is harder on us -- many times -- than on them.



It's the Jewish new year. Big holiday. Obscene amounts of food. Long hours in the synagogue. This year, I did something different. Instead of using the synagogue prayer book designated for the holiday, I took my own prayer book.

Where are we now? Income disparity soars, student loans threaten to be the next subprime mortgages, and millions of Americans struggle daily to make ends meet. Unmanageable, crippling debt is still harming millions of American families.

On Monday of this past week, the Pew Research Center released the results of a poll taken earlier this month about religion, with this heading, \Public Sees Religion's Influence Waning.\  The survey addressed a wide range of religious topics relating to life in America.
To the learned men and women who lead the Jewish faith I would like to offer a simple message


Christ-followers are given another angle of vision, another mirror into our souls, in the person of Jesus Christ. No passage of Scripture points more acutely to this image than one of this week's lectionary texts

No unambiguous passage supports Christians being \raptured\ before the tribulation. The Book of Revelation describes sufferings, many of which characterize much of the world we live in. But while Revelation depicts God protecting at least some of his people from his own judgment, it nowhere mentions Christians being removed.





Yes, it's true. No, I'm not going through an early mid-life crisis. Yes, I've really thought about it. No, my values have not changed. Yes, I'm sure. This is how my end of the conversation goes when I tell my friends that I'm in the process of becoming Catholic.
While the target audience in this case consists of Protestants, a.k.a. \Mainline Protestants,\ many other kinds of people \living faithfully\ in religious communities could recognize themselves in the issues involved, if not in the \selfie\ portraits of potential \aliens.\
Imagine this






Inspired by the original impulse of Occupy, I began gathering people for contemplative prayer and dialogues to cultivate wisdom resources for those of us who have quietly been working on building alternative structures for a new world.
In preparation for one of our high school reunion many years after graduation, the chairperson of our reunion suggested that each of us write about the best time of our lives. I gave this careful thought and simply wrote

This is not only an environmental issue, but also an economic and social issue. Communities, churches and individuals need to become and involved in working towards climate justice. The time to act is now. Tomorrow is already too late.
I look around at the congregation and see so many friends and familiar faces. My prayer book with my grandmother's inscription rests on my lap. I feel warm and connected. Hineni, I think, here I am.
It's time for progressive Christians to claim discipleship. It's time to get radical, not about our politics or our policies, but about our faith. It's time to stop throwing the baby Jesus out with the bath water, and start putting the horse before the cart.
When senseless tragedy occurs, people of faith often rush to explain and control. As finite human beings, we are limited in our knowledge and power, which makes us uncomfortable.


Americans have enough enemies without creating imaginary ones. But that is what Oklahoma Rep. John Bennett is doing by fear mongering against the whole American Muslim community. Bennett is creating imaginary Muslim enemies where none exist.
Over the years, Rosh Hashana has become associated with many recognizable objects and foods which you might see depicted on Rosh Hashana greeting cards or synagogue pamphlets.
If an Environmental Studies teacher is afraid to talk about climate change because of potential conflict, our planet is in deeper trouble than we think. So to face my own fear, I decided to write about the religious response to climate change.



Transitions prompt anxiety. Combinations of transitions can be simply overwhelming. Imagine what it must have been for the Israelites about to enter the land, the community they have created together barely coalescing.

An audience member asked if it would have been better if Saddam Hussein had remained in power. Interestingly, after brief hesitations, the answers were a resounding no. Saddam was evil and the situation under him was untenable.

Whether or not you think the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is a joke, the stakes are quite serious. Indeed, they go right to the heart of two essential questions


People around the world are suffering more now than at any time in my lifetime, and probably much longer. But the peoples of the world, including we who live in and love the United States, have become increasingly permissive and secular.


Keep your friends close, and your religious friends closer.

The unfathomable love and grace of God is what binds Willie Trottie to the person of Jesus.  The murders of Barbara and Titus Canada cannot keep Trottie from such grace and love.  Why is this so difficult to believe?
Be Bold. I cannot think of a better call to action for people of faith who care about reproductive health, rights and justice.
Moses had an anger problem. Actually, his anger  got him into trouble on more than one occasion. No, not for hitting a woman; we have no record of him ever doing so, but for allowing his anger to turn into murder on one occasion and disobedience to God on another.

By embracing a radical worldview, today's conservatives have abandoned the moral heritage of the West.





Few Christians today have even heard of the Didache, but this text allows us a glimpse into a largely forgotten form of early Christianity, one that stands in rather stark contrast to the Christianity developed by the Apostle Paul some decades after the death of Jesus.



Last week, I was arrested with more than 130 other advocates outside the White House. This is not the first time I have been arrested in an act of civil disobedience in front of the White House protesting our nation's immoral immigration system -- but I am praying that it is the last time.

I have found in taxi drivers, restaurant owners, municipal workers, police officers, firemen and women, \migrants\ and immigrants from many states, a variety of countries, generous people who love the democratic principles and virtues of these United States.



For all too long I have pondered the question, \What is my purpose?\\u00a0 I have often\u00a0raised my eyes toward Heaven and asked God, \What is it you want me to do?\ I have even had the audacity to scream at the great above.






For this month's show we're joined by Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution for a far-ranging chat on the foreign policy events that have been playing out in the Middle East over the last few years, including the Arab Spring, the rise of ISIS, and the escalation of conflict between Gaza and Israel this past month.


I ask you to instruct the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to tell Catholic institutions not to fire any more LGBTQ Catholics.  I ask you to speak out against laws that criminalize and oppress LGBTQ people around the globe. These actions would bring true life to your statement \Whom am I to judge?\
Maybe in our time of not-knowing, we who are white can realize that we should not try to be in charge for a change, that we should support the leadership of people of color, the experts in this movement. Maybe we can try to take a few steps forward together.
Long term, ISIS and the lure of other violent extremism in Islam and other religions will only be stopped if we are all invested in reaching out to young people. We have to be available to listen to their concerns, empathize with their sense of alienation, and help them find constructive ways to engage societal injustice. It is all of our responsibility to empower this generation with the knowledge and support they need to find a meaningful life and a positive identity that they can embrace and be proud of. ISIS and other radical groups are deadly serious about reaching out to young people with their skewed version of meaning that leads to death and destruction. Are we just as serious in reaching out to offer meaning that results in affirming life and creating a better world?
The world's first Festival of Faiths was held in Louisville, Ky., in November 1995. Now approaching its 20th anniversary year, the highly successful and internationally acclaimed festival is being emulated by neighboring city Indianapolis.









Deuteronomy calls us to let our land lie fallow in the seventh year, to break from planting and harvesting, and to let go of debts -- a sabbatical (shmita) year. Is this the summer storm before a season of joy and bounty, happiness and equity?

Tech gadgets would certainly compete with the immersive experience that sleep away camp creates for the young people. But does technology have no place whatsoever in the lives of campers?
In August 1964, mourners sang \We Shall Overcome\ at the memorial services and funerals for Andrew Goodman James Chaney and Michael Schwerner, three civil rights workers murdered in Mississippi. Fifty years later, it is still being sung at services and protests in Ferguson, Missouri.
Since none of us are sleeping, perhaps we can be anxious in solidarity, navigating our ways through unending night.

Scripture tells us that the weeping may last the night but joy comes in the morning. I sure hope so, because my heart is broken. Michael Brown is one of too many men and boys of color targeted and dehumanized by a system that operates as though some people are worth more than others.


With the nation's outrage in full view, I believe that this case gives an outlet to a rising sense of power felt by parents and youth alike to call into question the behavior exhibited by those who are sworn to protect and serve all citizens.
Today, I write a letter from the jailhouse of race. This jail has no visible walls, but there are walls nonetheless. If we do not rise up against them and tear them down, we will remain trapped and afraid.
Dying Black youth are the window onto the spiritual trauma that affects an entire nation. The lives of young Black men and women, far from expendable and cheap, are an incredible gift to us.







The frustration and disbelief, rage and disappointment, resignation and passion I heard moved me. But even more convicting was the fact that so many others were simply unaware of this event at the moment and unfazed by its repercussions.
'I don't have to filter what I say!' Sharon Petzinger, a wildlife biologist who studies birds for the state of New Jersey, said this to me with a light of joy in her eyes. Hannah Ryan, a grad student at the University of Colorado, echoed the sentiment.
I can't count the number of hours that I've waited with (literally) bated breath, hoping and praying that someone will say \Of course you're Egyptian! I could totally tell.\ But I think what I've really always wanted to hear is, \You belong with us.\
Even if there were such a place as hell (which, again, there isn't), no God worth a shredded church bulletin would send a person there for feeling so hurt and unloved that he or she was driven to the ultimate expression of despair.
In my opinion, Ingersoll missed the true currents of religion, of the possibility of an open and liberal spirituality. But he certainly brought a lot to the table. May he be remembered for standing against the powers that be and the demons of cheap faith, and for championing the endless power of not knowing.
The debate over the large-scale migration of children from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico has characteristically devolved into political theater. The evidence builds regarding the dangers that have driven the children's flight.
This is a hellish poem because an accidental click in Twitter today, brought me to see VERY GRAPHIC photos that I cannot unsee...

I'm also saddened when I see anyone -- especially someone who calls themselves a Christian -- rejoicing in his humiliation or suffering. Yes, we can find hope and encouragement in Driscoll being held accountable, but to revel in his public shaming is not Christ-like.

There seems little doubt that the self-styled radical Islamist group, Islamic State, is committing genocide in Iraq, certainly against the Yazidis, and has targeted Christians to \convert or die\ as well.
Earlier this year, the Christian film \God's Not Dead,\ was released.  It was an indictment of academia, liberalism, and some business people, but as the Ebola crisis unfolded in West Africa and in nearby Atlanta, maybe those who attack Christianity aren't who we think they are.




Rather than simply dismissing the show as being blasphemous, maybe we should continue to watch with an awareness of contemporary issues and a strong sense of irony. To do so, would ask us to consider what then does it mean to have a black Jesus living and moving in impoverished black spaces?

But here's the question I cannot escape


As a scholar of religion who is gay (and -- by the way -- currently celibate), I staunchly oppose this heretical Christian claim that the rare spiritual gift of and vocation to celibacy is automatically to be assigned to an entire group of people merely because of their affectional or sexual orientation.
The world is aflame. Religious minorities are among those who suffer most from increasing conflict. Pakistan is one of the worst homes for non-Muslims. The U.S. government should designate that nation as a \Country of Particular Concern\ for failing to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.

\Here he comes, here he comes...\ the collective thought hovered in the air as hundreds of spiritual seekers filled the Marble Collegiate Church in NYC.
Poet John Donne famously recognized the similarity of sexual and religious ecstasy. Born Catholic, he became an Anglican priest and the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, as well as a poet both bawdy and religious.
Sometimes evangelical Christians make movies. And usually they are horrible. The themes are poorly executed. Instead of life imitated in inspiring ways through the medium of film, a sermon is smugly preached.

In this world where so much seems beyond our will, what is within our grasp to hold on to?


Somehow the preaching of the \good news\ has become the blasting of negative messages.  The most common of those negative news is the preaching that urges us to go out and do better, to work harder, to do more.
Joseph wears his privilege too proudly. Oblivious to the fact that his older brothers despise him, he shares with them two vivid dreams. In each, the world revolves around Joseph -- the world bows down to serve him.




My hope is that, like Trungpa's idea of an empty heart, each time I am re-souled through Shabbat, there is more tenderness and less tangibility, a waking up of my soul, an opening of my heart, and a chance to practice making everything holy, at least one day a week.

Objectively, there's no denying that today Islamic extremism poses more of a threat than other types of religious fanaticism. There are complex historical, social, and cultural reasons for this. But this is not a matter of the text of the Qur'an being inherently more susceptible to intolerant interpretations than the Bible.


In 1782 an act of Congress determined that the latin phrase \e pluribus unum\ would become the motto of a fledgling nation.

Too often, we draw a false distinction between words and deeds, underestimating the impact that words can have on our souls and communities. We presume harsh words to be fair game online, in the mysterious ether of \virtual\ interaction.
The war for same gender marriage has been won. I received the news today. I didn't read it in the newspaper, didn't see it on the news crawl at the bottom of the screen on CNN. I heard the announcement from a 17 year-old kid, out in the middle of the rural midwest.

In this broken city teeming with hurt and frustration a looming tragedy approaches. This tragedy is not new; we have seen it before and will most assuredly will again.


We must cultivate our souls and do the necessary spiritual work to sustain our holy efforts to transform the world. The task is so great. We are not only charged to create a more just world for ourselves but even for our enemies.


His leaving was as unconventional as his teaching and his life. Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi wanted no casket, no plain pine box. For his funeral, held on the Fourth of July, he wanted to be clothed in his white kittel.



In these remaining few hours or Ramadan, do your best to spend a little bit of time with yourself and look inside your heart to see what are you carrying with you as you leave this month. Each of you has so much to share with this world.

For the first time in my life, I got an opportunity to spend Ramadan outside my home country, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The mantra of an \Islamic\ state of Pakistan is continuously blared on every other media one comes across. But, is real Islam being practiced?

Climate change is one of the biggest and most divisive environmental issues we've faced. Not only is the science scary and the challenge daunting, but it calls into question the very way we live our lives. With all this rhetoric going back and forth, what's a Christian in the U.S. supposed to believe?


A first step in helping to heal the antagonistic separation between non-affirming and affirming Christians and congregations, is for all to open their eyes to the ways that LGBT Christians are already blessing -- and possibly even renewing -- the Church as a whole.
Based on my conversations with folks at IAMCR and even back in the United States, progress is being made to help \de-politicize\ Hinduism. It will eventually mean Hindus - no matter how they self-define or self-identify - can start to more boldly be part of the public sphere without politicized or attacked for doing so.
Max Steinberg, a Los Angeles native who upped and moved to Israel alone to volunteer with the Israeli Defense Forces died in combat on Sunday. But according to an editor at Slate, it wasn't Hamas who killed this 24-year-old.



We've also seen heroes that our world is need of.  Doctors and medics from around the world, relief agencies and their workers, and many others who know their life is at risk being on the ground in Gaza but they still do what they can to help.
The advance of ISIS in Syria and Iraq has all but wiped out some of the most ancient Christian communities. Some of the most important early Christian manuscripts which resided in monasteries there have been burned.
Do you want conspiracy theorists to create the nation's scientific research agenda? Does it make sense to take their bizarre views seriously?
Ramadan is the month of fasting and a time for spiritual growth among Muslims. The traditionalist approach to \spiritual growth\ is for Muslims to complement their fasting with performing additional prayers at night and regular reading of the Quran throughout the month.
Tom Petty's a great rock artist, one of the best in history. But for those Christian fans of his, he's become quite the heartbreaker. Is his argument that religion leads to war on target, or does he miss the mark?
What might have been an excellent piece of reporting on an important public-health concern in India has turned out instead to be one of the most absurd, far-fetched, and ugly pieces of Hinduphobic racism in journalism ever.

Hatred and revenge is the easy road to reaction and even action, but they are never to be confused as the catalyst for change.
How can we draw on the ancient wisdom of Biblical Israel as an indigenous people in sacred relationship with the Earth? How can we use this storehouse of wisdom toward helping heal all Humanity and Mother Earth today, from a crucial planetary crisis threatening the very life and health of all of us?
As a bereavement counselor, it is my job to help create a safe space to give voice to the unspeakable, and to companion others in their grief journey as they travel into the wilderness of their soul in search of their own inner knowing and truth.
It is time to blow the whistle on religious demagogues who say they are victims if they are not allowed to take away the rights of others.
We all know that where a child is born shouldn't determine how long she lives, but it does.  However, we must remember that under God, there is a universal citizenship -- a status that makes us all equal under His eyes and worthy of love, dignity and respect.




The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, was constantly doing good for people, whether they were his supporters or not. It's one thing to be good to people who are treating you well. It's another to be good to someone who isn't.
I serve as a University Chaplain for New York University and Executive Director of the Islamic Center at NYU.  Earlier today, I delivered a short sermon that I was recommended to share with you by some of my community members as today's reflection.


Bill O'Reilly disputed the two main points of my recent blog on The O'Reilly Factor broadcast
I met my wife, Joy Carroll, at Greenbelt, a summer festival of faith, arts, and justice in England. I have a vivid memory of returning to Greenbelt in 2002 with our son Luke.  Joy was on the worship platform celebrating the Eucharist for 20,000 people. Luke looked up at me and said, \Daddy, can men do that too?\


Many American Jewish leaders fear that interfaith relationships will be the downfall of the Jewish community. But from the perspective of a Jewish guy that fell in love with a Christian girl, my marriage is not the problem. The Jewish community is.
I'm no lover of fences, of the limitations, boundaries and delineations they represent. Yes, sometimes they're necessary. In some ways, such boundaries actually afford us the confidence and safety to stretch ourselves, to go farther than we would have without any sense of place, of where the unknown begins.



Greater comfort, I think, is to be found in the realization that infinity is as problematic for science as it is for religion. Much as an infinitely perfect God leads to logical clashes with reality, an infinite multiverse bedevils attempts to apply tools such as probabilities to our understanding of the world.

The fatalistic belief in the end of humanity, most often because of our sins or lack of virtue, is as frightening as it is harmful. If we believe that no matter what we do, the majority of us will perish in some reign of heavenly or demonic fire, what is our motivation to plan for our collective future?
Members of a young Earth, fundamentalist Christian sect from the United States have found their way to Scotland and have been promoting their beliefs in a public elementary school. Part of their missionary work has been to distribute \science\ books to the students.
I was privileged enough to chat with Stanley Hauerwas on how our theology impacts our perception of the Other, our political allegiances, and our desired response to our enemies.
If you have Baha'i friends, you can ask them what day of what Badi month of what Vahid it is, and if they look a little confused please be forgiving as it may take some time to get adjusted to a new way of measuring one of our most precious common resources -- time.
Inerrancy, literalism, or unexamined belief in the Bible, why does Fundamentalism still have a strong hold on so many Christians today?
In a world where it has become exceedingly common and even trendy to be apathetic towards a different people's struggle, you are, by default, already doing something by feeling what you're feeling.
As I prepared to observe Guru Purnima something clicked. Wow! Guru Purnima is observed by the entire Dharmic community -- Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and Sikhs and it also has a strong message of environmental harmony.
The White House iftar is a slap in the face to those in the Muslim community who have been victims of U.S. civil-rights and human-rights abuses. It is an attempt by administration after administration to whitewash the crimes of the U.S. government against Muslims.

Identity formation always includes a process of othering, of demarcating oneself from those who are different. But what if one's identity has two sides?
Growing up, my understanding of God was always tainted by a negative framing.  Through Sunday schools and Friday sermons, I learned that God was watching me, but only later on in life I understood that God was watching over me-- two very different things.


While we here in America continue the Hobby Lobby debate, there are religious freedom matters with serious life and death consequences elsewhere in the world right now, today, which also deserve your attention.

History can also be highly politicized, as we continue to see in states such as Texas, where small but vocal groups envisage instructional materials and curriculum shaped solely by their own worldviews.
I believe people of faith need to imagine a world without God. We then might take greater responsibility for our own lives and the circumstances of others, as well as life on this planet.

Pinchas saved the day when he put an end to the forbidden relationship between the Jewish tribal leader, Zimri and the Midianite woman, Cozbi. But who was Cozbi, and what was her mission?

As a Muslim of Indian background, I have wondered how to counter misinformation about my religion while striving to build greater interfaith connections among traditions common in South Asia.

Western music comes with Western privilege and, like white privilege, this type of agency does not need to crossover to the margins because Western pop stars are already idolized the world over.

On Trinity Sunday in June 2007, I went to a little church that met in a photographer's studio above a coffee shop in a historic business district near Duke University in Durham, N.C.
When I was holding her in those last moments as her breaths slowed, her eyes, which had half shut and glazed, suddenly opened, focused on me and then beyond me.


Religion (in any form) should exist to assist in the progress of giving us new language, new ways of being and new ways of treating one another. If a religion fails at this, it should be seen as a disease, and like any disease should be eradicated immediately.
For the most part, Schachter-Shalomi's success was based in his liberal acceptance of people exploring alternate paths of spiritual awakening (from LSD to Yoga), and his legitimizing of alternate possibilities within Judaism.

Bilam tries to curse the Jews, but G-d has other plans.


I believe that through deep and honest dialogue and communication between cultures, races, genders, religions and ideas, mutual understanding and the discovery of our common humanity and aspirations can and will be found.
Whatever walk of life you come from, please do keep them in your thoughts and prayers.  For those who are fasting, encourage your community leaders, imams, khateebs and others to pray for the Rohingya with the community at large, especially in the blessed nights of Ramadan, and try to contribute to them whatever you are able to.


As a Taoist monk, I find the notion of the Earth as a superorganism to make perfect sense; I also find the notion of evolution as a propulsive, all-encompassing, and all-pervasive force to be completely congruent with the ancient Chinese concept of Tao.


Even though I don't probably do what most people do for a living, I was making the same mistakes that many people make in regards to how they prioritize their careers over themselves.



Keep Muhammed Abu Khdeir, his loved ones, and the people of Palestine in your prayers. For those who are observing the month of Ramadan, remember all of them as you break your fast and stand in qiyaam during these blessed nights.
The Bible often warns against trusting the wrong sources (e.g., false prophets). But in the story of Balaam, the Bible warns against placing too much trust in the right sources -- in this case Moses. The Bible's warning is particularly pertinent to us today, since we are particularly prone to the error of excessively trusting our sources.
Chapter 1 (Fatiha) is possibly the most-read chapter of the Quran. It is an integral part of Muslim prayers and is repeated tens of times in a day. Yet we must ask ourselves

American Muslims from across the country share their stories of love and marriage as a matter of choice -- as it should be. They are reflective of the more mainstream American-Muslim experience while also representing a model to be emulated by others.
Several years ago it dawned on me that most all of my spiritual heroes are unabashedly ecumenical. If you read their writings, you'll find themes of radical inclusivity, radical compassion, and radical identification.
While we may never be able to stop violence in the name of religion, we can prevent it at home and in our lives by remembering and instilling in each other basic ethical principles that are held by all religious traditions.
Perhaps it is our job, we insider sheep, to take our eyes off the controversy and place them on the shepherd, who may be not so much seeking our opinion on the matter as executing his own.

Sometimes guidance can feel terrifying, I won't lie. Being guided to do the right thing is hard, we worry how it will be received. But, that starts to go away.
One hopes for fresh approaches after the bishops have \consulted the faithful\ in matters of doctrine and practice. No one will envy them in their efforts to revisit -- or revise? -- the Church's teachings.


Peacemaking is among the good deeds incumbent on Muslims during the holy month of fasting and prayer. Distribution of charity and food, customary at Ramadan, is needed especially by people displaced by conflict. How, then, will Ramadan be celebrated in the countries worst affected by the latest Middle East crisis?


the supporters of Hobby Lobby think they are being \pro-life.\  They are wrong.  Contraception coverage without a co-pay could dramatically reduce the abortion rate.
We need to stand with those in Sudan, and across the world, who will not accept this restricting of personal freedoms. We must champion freedom of belief and press for countries to allow people to choose a religion, or choose none.
There has been so much pain for rabbis in the past few months, and I have to wonder if this pressure, fatigue, and pain is getting to everyone. Perhaps we need to learn better self-care.






Beyond the heart-wrenching reality of the aftermath of terror, beyond the mobilization of forces to find these boys and bring the kidnappers to justice, how can we respond to these despicable acts?





This young man arrived at the beach that Sunday with beat up sneakers and circles under his eyes. Call it proselytizing, but he wasn't getting anything out of this other than the pleasure of talking about God.



So Green told a story, and it garnered various responses from the Christian world. It made us think, and maybe that's what stories should do. Maybe it's better than pretending to have all the answers about sexuality and eternity.



On one level the World Cup in Brazil resembles lived religion with fans as ecstatic worshipers at the cathedrals that are the massive soccer stadiums. But on another level, the current games to crown the quadrennial world champion couldn't be more Catholic.

Does being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have anything to do with practicing mindfulness? Sure. Over the years, many LGBT voices have made themselves heard within Buddhist communities, and have enriched the sangha as a result.

The sustainability of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people has always been dependent on its ability to deliver justice to the Palestinians. We learned in South Africa that the only way to end apartheid peacefully was to force the powerful to the table through economic pressure.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the leader who more than any other human being alive is associated with the successful use of divestment to help overturn apartheid in South Africa, is calling on Presbyterians to choose divestment from the Israeli occupation.
We know that there are many like Daniel in Tucson, and in every community in our nation. We know that we need to be prepared.\u00a0 Our congregation has begun to pray and talk about what God is calling us to do, and what it means to be a sanctuary church in 2014



I hope that, as all sports should, it can be a means to the end. I hope, as the Pope said, that it can be a means to the end of genuine solidarity, a solidarity that recognizes that a soccer pitch shouldn't be the only level playing field.





Christians who still want to preach Hell, should at least know what they're talking about.
The church can be relevant, meaningful and important and we must be able to share this with the world. As I ponder such issues, I realize that I am a product of a \cloud of witnesses\ who have gone before me to light the way for me to be in the church and be a leader within the theological academy.
Religion doesn't simply offer a set of positions to conform to; it also offers the acceptable ways in which one can transgress these positions. It tells us both how to conform and how to not conform in a conformist way.
They will still be there, even if you no longer have to lay your eyes on them.






What happens around tables designed to encourage the people of God to see one another, face to face? I would argue that justice, too, begins on a micro-scale at our church.
The upcoming proposal to ban recognition of transgender (including intersex) identities by the Southern Baptist Convention, though put forth by a college professor of ethics, is neither well-educated in its understanding of the complex biology of gender nor ethical.
When the Bible spoke of our dominion over the animals, surely it isn't speaking of cruelty towards animals, but responsibility and stewardship. And implicit in stewardship is love and caring.
Something extraordinary happened in that room. In the midst of the roomful of people acknowledging each other for their best qualities, one could palpably feel the energy in the room spiraling up and rising. Until a moment came when the energy had lifted to a place of unification.




I confess to a certain deep consolation--maybe it is hope after all--lying somewhere inside me next to that ball of grief, as I recollect the faces and faith of my students.
Having run Buddhist centers for the last decade, I am aware that many people come to the meditation practice in their forties or later.
Boycotting and divesting from companies that profit from the Israeli occupation are not actions aimed against Jews in Israel. Rather, they are means of sending a clear message to the Israeli government that its treatment of the Palestinians is abhorrent.
Since the US is religiously the most diverse nation in the world, it is crucial that we educate ourselves about different religions. It is like being multilingual
What does Buddhism have to say about genetically modified food? Needless to say, the Buddha didn't know anything about DNA, much less the possibilities of modifying it technologically.
Salvation does not merely mean going to heaven after our physical death. Salvation in Jesus means recovering wholeness right now in new resurrected life. It means through the spirit becoming everything that Jesus is in relationships dedicated to humility, reconciliation and love.
Liberals, atheists, progressives, Jungians (the list is endless) have their fundamentalists and literalists too. It's not just Bible thumpers and Islamic fanatics. The problem? The triumph of scientific language as the privileged language.
\We need passionately moderate Muslims\, argues former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Moderates, yes, but not tepid or vacillating moderates; instead, moderates with vim, ready to engage and to bring about change.


And, what does \abundant life\ really mean? And, what does it mean to be \awake\ or to come down from a mountain, face radiant with presence?


Let me start by saying \Love Song for a Savior\ on Jars of Clay's Flood album helped me survive the darkest moments of 8th grade.

I first met Ram Dass at the Lama Foundation in the mountains of Northern New Mexico when I was fourteen, and our paths have intertwined ever since.
The quest for religious freedom and equal rights is ongoing, but for years, Hindus have largely been left out of the conversation as victims of religious discrimination and violence.








The instructions given me were clear -- that my words should recognize the diversity present in the chamber. And that is what is disappointing about this ruling

Though at times it seems that our nation's leaders have been more interested in leasing out our public lands to oil and gas companies, I believe this new National Monument represents a sea change within the administration. The time has come.

We need to ensure that the friends we choose are those who are uplifting, encouraging, believing and helpful to our purpose. Here are just a few wisdom tips for choosing right, godly and wholesome friends.

This year as we pay tribute to the many men and women who serve through teaching, we are inspired by those who are also healing through yoga and other therapies.

If God had just chilled for a little longer back then, all of our weekends could be a little longer now. But no; go-getter God was up and at 'em on Day Eight. No case of the Monday Mornings for the Almighty.

The assertion that Islam did not necessitate marriage and permitted the rape of female \slaves\ and captives is utterly baseless. Quite to the contrary, Islam broke the prevailing taboo regarding marriage with \slaves.\
The latest party to file a lawsuit against the state of North Carolina is the Cleveland-based United Church of Christ, marking the first time an entire religious denomination has joined a legal battle to repeal a statewide gay marriage ban.
Another shooting, this time in Santa Barbara, with legally purchased guns. You probably think it's partially my fault. Why? Because I am a Godless American.
May the memory of those who died in service to our country be a blessing and may we be inspired by those who serve to bring justice, wholeness, and peace to a broken world and all of its inhabitants.
Shavuot reminds Jews of our religious roots and obligations. America, though, is anchored in a dedication to liberty for all citizens no matter what they believe. This is what unites us in a civic heritage no religious tradition ever can or should try to duplicate.
While working on our own sincerity, we have to realize that the reality is, we will rarely meet sincere people. We will rarely meet people who will genuinely step out of themselves to attempt to see things from our perspective and act accordingly.

We all need to call out to the God of life and ask God to lead us to justice and peace. We need to join together and work for social justice as the earth is crying out and pleading with us.


Pope Francis has shown us a faithful, peaceful approach to the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. All of us can follow his example.  We are all Pope Francis now.  It is up to all of us.


In a much overlooked description of 'the Essenes', attributed to the Third-Century Early Church theologian Hippolytus in Rome, there exists a completely original version of Josephus' famous description of them.


If ever we met a tragic hero, it would be Job. I like Job too. I admire him. But this week I noticed something about Job that complicates my relationship with him. Job holds something in common with Robert E. Lee







I see marriage equality as a victory for religious freedom and a decision entirely consistent with Christian ethics.
Jesus loses his life, and he is not the only one to suffer loss. Those he leaves behind lose him, and without him, they lose whatever security they might have felt in the world. After his death, they take refuge by hiding.










If the Church was able to clarify its understanding of Scripture based on Galileo's new information about the heavens, then we can surely clarify our reading of the Bible based on new information about same-sex relationships.


Being a woman is more than a mother. It's being the person God calls us to be bringing love into the world. I have moments of mothering, and I thank Mother God that I can fill that space from time to time.



The image of Orthodoxy according to Putin is vastly different, and has been further complicated by some of America's political religious right's agreement with Putin.

GFU should not get to respect a student on paper, in press releases, and in letters by using their preferred pronoun but then in practice and policy choose not to. If you choose to see Jayce as he is in one context, you must see him as he wholly in all situations.
Rev. Graham, I had to take issue with you when you said you agreed with Vladimir Putin that we need to protect the children and not allow gays to adopt.  You believe only a man and a woman in a \traditional\ marriage can properly raise a child up in to the way they should go.

This past week I was in Florida completing some work for the college. I was trying to resolve quite a few issues, checking on college finances as we quickly approach the end of the fiscal year and finalizing plans for graduation. My head was swirling with things I needed to complete.
Sex is a simple pleasure that grows all out of proportion when it's denied. If Mother Nature were allowed to have her way, this would be a far better place. And who's behind all the brouhaha? God? Actually, it's religion.

Faith communities are also religious organizations, and those organizations emerged over a period of many decades, and developed (not accidentally) in parallel with the rise of America's industrial economy.
I like the way Rabbi Kaplan defines it. He says spirituality is \the progressive unlearning of the strange ideas about God you've been taught...\
There is always sadness in the news that a marriage has ended in divorce. Whatever the circumstances, a divorce marks the death of the dream of happily-ever-after and the end of a relationship that was entered into with hope, joy and the intention that it be until-death-do-us-part.









Last weekend leaders of the Jesuit School of Theology and the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology along with other prominent Roman Catholic thinkers gave papers at the Pacific Coast Theological Society.
We should ask if there are ways by which we ought to replace the avenging means of justice with those that are redemptive and restorative.
If we are going to fight for the rights to exercise our faith as our conscience dictates, as is our Constitutional right in the United States, then we must get behind this lawsuit in North Carolina as this is, plain and simple, a freedom of religion question.


There is a difference between critiquing Islam and spreading irrational fear of Muslims. There is a difference between intellectually commenting on a religion and inciting hatred of its adherents.

If you're seeking a fresh way to experience and practice your faith, if you're a long-term Christian seeking new vitality, or if you feel out of place in traditional church circles, Brian's new book will be sure to inspire and activate you in your spiritual journey.
As someone about to become a seminarian in the state, I can't quite wrap my head around the idea that while receiving Communion on Sunday, one of my fellow congregants might be packing heat.

We can be dismissive of these events as isolated cases but, to do that would undermine a key factor
I am a Christian. I love Christians. I have great hope for the Christian church. But throughout my journey one thing has repeatedly frustrated me.
Maybe I'm a near-sighted Bible-thumping holy roller, but I can't see angel wings flapping on oil executives. No doubt some are community pillars. They're Little League umpires, tithers and PTA volunteers. They've got lovely houses and manicured lawns.






There was no bar mitzvah, no ceremony where a rabbi and temple congregants congratulated him, no family and friends invited from far and wide. I am sad about this and, yet, here we are, a couple days away from the sleepover and paintball party that will mark my son's coming of age.

Late at night, Mark Whitacre watched an FBI agent leave his home and walk toward the car, gone at last and completely oblivious to the corporate crime at work in a Fortune 500 company. It was over.

Unless the two views join forces, we won't be using our full human capability to solve problems. Such a comprehensive human effort is precisely what global solutions require.

I was a troublemaker in Sunday school. No, not because I was passing notes (though they were passed, discreetly). I was a troublemaker because I did the worst thing a young Southern Baptist born and raised girl can do

Not many people can run like Meb, but our youth can all learn to reach for one another as fellow citizens and friends, and resist the evil that we hope has now been purged from the city of Boston on a sunny Patriot's Day.



Appalled both by the concentrations of wealth enjoyed by the French aristocracy and by their callous exploitation of the poor, Thomas Jefferson proposed an antidote for the fledgling United States

The immediate release of the Metropolitans would send a powerful, positive, and encouraging Easter message to all those men, women and children who have suffered from the war, kidnappings and the deteriorating human security in Syria.
Today, we are able to exercise our religious beliefs because of the courageous women and men who came before us.  Let's learn about some of the women who strove for religious freedom.
I expected him to do well and show me some of his work. The money could be renewed for the second semester and the next year of college. Though I imagined that Mel would want to maintain periodic contact -- at least it was what I hoped -- I was wrong.

Still, what kind of life do we live when we are filled with bitter resentment and refuse to move forward and embrace new opportunities?
The truth is, you're loved, you're seen, you're not worthless. You're valuable. You're precious. Easter is about making sure you know that.


Easter was to my mother what Christmas was to me -- the best of the best.  When I was old enough to articulate my preference for Christmas, I'd start with the unpleasantness of 'Good Friday.' How could torturing someone to death be the cause for celebration?

We are challenged these days by the ugly reminders of anti-Semitism on both sides of the Ukrainian conflict and, of course, so recently in our own backyard. We must both remain vigilant against those who would do us harm and anticipate not increasing danger but redemption and peace.
That was where Jesus spent Holy Saturday


Easter, if it is to mean anything, must always stands face to face with Good Friday, and the crucifixion. Because God knows the crucifixions did not stop because the resurrection happened.

Millions of people from all parts of the world will celebrate Easter because they, like I, believe what the early Gospel writers wrote about
Hope is never more needed than on the Saturdays we face. Something has gone. Something has died. Something or someone that once filled a great place within has left us just as empty as we were once full, just as lonely as we were once befriended, just as uncertain as we once were so sure.
Can one legitimately speak, as does the Pope, of one's personal guilt in an instance like this, where others notably sinned?
Throughout Holy Week, Orthodoxy is in grieving for Christ's ascent to Calvary and his crucifixion but on the day of the Resurrection there is the cleansing from sin and the restart of the human race.
Holy Saturday is a day when hell is emptied out, and maybe that can give us the hope that our own present personal hells can be harrowed as well.

Holy Week should not be interpreted to mean that we are responsible for the death of Christ, or that God's honor would be offended if he simply forgave our sins, or that the point of Jesus' life was his suffering and death, or that this death magically erases the consequences of what we actually have done.
