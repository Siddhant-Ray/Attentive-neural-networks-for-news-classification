I loved who I was when I was drunk. I was witty and confident and fun. But that is me all the time... I just wasn't comfortable being me without the liquid courage. I couldn't find myself when I was sober, because I hadn't tried looking.
One may label it 'loving' all day long, profess it from the rooftops and paint it across the sky, but love it is not. Love does not exist in a dark cave of longing and desperation. Those feelings are the offspring of fear.
I can be seen as a \cancer patient going through chemotherapy\ yet this is not what this story is about -- it's about love. It's not about current conventional medical treatments, side effects, limitations or miracles. It's about sister magic.

Stress is one word we don't like to talk about. I've listened to those in leadership call for it when they say, \I'm so stressed,\ \I'm stressed out\! But the truth is the something called \stress\ is nothing short of an inner, physical feeling of anxiety or \strain.\

Everywhere I look lately on social media I am inundated with women tearing one another down. Whether it's an article on the Kardashians, the newest Victoria's Secret campaign, or the hottest Instagram sexy selfie seductress--we women are downright vicious in the comments sections.
Dating is, in one word, stressful. The whole getting-to-know-someone process mixed with \trying to act the part\ so you don't look crazy has gotten a bit out of control. Following the unwritten rules of dating is intimidating and overwhelming. Let's explore.

Instead of sending a woman a picture of your manhood, send them a photo of an adorable little duckling. I promise you this is 1,000x more likely to garner an \AWWW\ than your penis ever will.

I haven't met a woman yet without at least one \sisterhood wound\ that has impacted her trust of other women. Some of us trust too easily and let the wrong women in too close and get hurt. Others have little to no trust and so let in a few to none or keep old friends around mistaking years known for intimacy and trust -- and so miss out on true sisterhood.
Abortion has been with us as long as has pregnancy. It will not go away. Should safe, legal abortion become inaccessible (the goal of Republicans), women in large numbers will choose other options.
Right now, future husband, I guess you're a mystery like Bigfoot or those darned unicorns we just can't seem to track down. But I know one day when we finally meet, you'll be my best friend. And I can't be more excited to fall in love with you.
I'm 19, and am in no way planning on having kids any time soon (so you can breathe a sigh of relief, Mom). But I'm excited to meet you kiddos one day. I'm also scared that I won't live up to your expectations or mine. I can, however, promise you these 10 things though, and for now, I think that's pretty good.
You will lose out on jobs that you are perfectly qualified for. Your apartment application will be rejected. People will swipe left on you. It's a tough world out there, kiddo.
A happy, intimate and successful love relationship is based in each person being fully supported, loved and respected with forethought and consideration in all decisions individually and collectively.
So, which states didn't make the grade? These are the places where women's reproductive rights are the most at risk.

In the past 7 years; in several of my Empowerment Programs for Women world-wide, I've had the honor and the opportunity to work face to face and shoulder to shoulder with Muslim Women.

When I was 7 years old, I had a panic attack at a restaurant while on vacation with my family in Greece. We were in the middle of dinner when suddenly inexplicable feelings of dread and fear began to consume me.
Remember, ladies
The Obama administration has announced that, as of 2020, the ten dollar bill will have a woman's face on it. It's about time! Inspired, I asked my Face Book friends
Father's Day can be the most difficult time of the year for children who have lost their father - especially when Mom has moved on before the children are ready. Many fans of the SecretRegrets.com project have anonymously confessed their regrets about dealing with the loss of a father.

The language that asked women what they felt and needed was not spoken in our mother's and grandmother's day. They did not know how to ask themselves what they felt and needed, and they did not know how to teach their daughters how to honor their own feelings and needs.
Feminists are given a bad wrap. When I was growing up, women who wanted to excel in the workforce were demonized as anti-family, bra burning egoists.
You are a planner, I know. You like to know what to expect, whether it means preparing for a test, a job interview or for life's large milestones.
Daddy was the dominant influence on my life -- eventually. It wasn't till I delivered his eulogy, when I was 50 years old, that I realized he had given me an entire philosophy of life and leadership.

I knew full well I wouldn't be able to reach my belly button. That, my friends, was the victory right there. Not being able to introduce my innie to my pinkie reinforced my successful departure from daily perfection quests and food fears.
The right to abortion is grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects all of us from undue government interference with our liberty interests.  More than 20 years ago, the Supreme Court made this clear when it reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.

The strength in these feminist empowerment projects is clear to fans who use them to navigate their own lives, but I want to highlight the message for other artists
When faced with a conflict with someone else, people often do not know how to proceed. Having a method to deal with problems can be helpful.
Stop making things harder than they have to be. Why is it when people want something so bad -- that they can taste it, that they find every reason why they can't get it?

I've had two experiences in the past few days that tied into some key life lessons that are useful in both our personal and professional lives (which as many people will tell you these days is one and the same).

My answer to, \How do you land a book deal?\ is really multi-faceted and involves a long-haul approach. I'm sure I don't have to tell you that this kind of stuff rarely happens overnight. But if you're willing to put in the hours, the rewards are absolutely incredible.
Androgynous, confident characters like Ruby Rose's Stella Carlin have appeal that transcends labels.
Self-defense training has been completely left out of the current rush to develop effective prevention strategies, especially on college campuses.
As I grew up I realized it is less important to have a ton of friends, and more important to have real ones instead.

I'm a huge soccer fan. Always have. Always will. It's not a sport many Americans play nor do they relate to. We tend to go for basket ball, baseball and the un-official holiday of Super Bowl.
I've been in love, lust and like, had crushes that didn't crush back and had my heart broken. I've lost it all and won big. Throughout, I have never believed in \perfect\ anything. Did I mention that I do not believe in soul mates?
Did you know you have a secret weapon? You carry it with you every day. You were born with it. Sometimes it turns red and sometimes you have to get it checked. It's also your largest organ. It's your skin!
We get to choose how we define what it means to be a woman and we also get to define feminism. There's room for stay at home mothers, women with career ambitions, the single mother who struggles to support her children, the wealthy Upper East Side wife, and, yes, Caitlyn Jenner.
Even when I saw, very clearly, that dieting was keeping me in a never-ending cycle of restricting and binge eating, it was still very scary to give up. There's so much safety in following a plan, and so much hope that this time will be the one that works.
Confidence is aqueous and ever-changing. Just when you think you're grasping it in your hands, it can trickle through your fingers. I am reminded of this as I awkwardly haul a leg over the torso of my lover and sink into his chest as we sink deeper into the soft mattress in our room at the W.

If you frequently feel as though you are running on the hamster wheel of life -- exhausted, stressed, and discouraged -- join me on stable ground. Parenting, career and marriage are a beautiful thing once you discover what really matters.
And as far as the love we give to your kids goes, well, that comes naturally to us. Babies are born from the womb, but maternity comes from the soul. There are many way to be maternal. Thank you for giving us a deeply meaningful way to exercise our maternal muscle.
Victim. While it is not my primary identity, it will always be a part of who I am. Frequently, the media praises victims for \not allowing themselves to be called a victim.\ As if it were degrading and demeaning words along the lines of \slut.\
Women of the world
You can give anyone a rundown on the latest season of \24,\ Net Neutrality or the Amazon vs. Hachette showdown, but when it comes to talking about yourself, it's a much different story -- especially when asked about your professional experience, industry, desires and goals.
Just as Ariana Grande -- pop princess, wearer of cat ears -- revealed herself to the world as a self-possessed female standing up for other women, Beyonc\u00e9 -- fierce, outspoken feminist, champion of equality -- told us her secret to flatter abs. It was a confusing day.

Matt McGorry is a rising Hollywood star, with leading roles in Netflix's \Orange Is The New Black\ and ABC's \How To Get
Caitlyn Jenner's transformation was fascinating and inspiring to so many of us -- not only for the social change it means for our world, but also because it is rare to see any reinvention that is so total.

\u201cWhat makes a woman?\u201d It\u2019s a big question, and one that a June 6 New York Times piece, written by journalist Elinor Burkett
I was an awkward, skirted-suit-wearing 7-year-old my first day of swim team practice in 1984. My participation on a USA Swimming team improved my confidence, provided me with life-long friends, and helped me develop physical fitness that I still maintain today as a 37-year-old mother of four. It was also in this context that I met my coach and rapist, Christopher Huott.
Being a pioneer has many rewards; some tangible and some equally wonderful intangible ones. The benefits spread much wider than we can ever imagine. And what about you? What difficult communication challenge are you facing? Can you find the common ground to break through to the collaboration?
Jim Bob claims that, \This wasn't rape or anything like that. This was touching over the clothes.\ This perception that touching is somehow less traumatic than penetration is not only false, it is incredibly damaging to victims, and helps perpetuate a culture of victim-blaming.
We don't need to marginalize ourselves. We don't have to play down the parts of our personality that want to be seen. We don't have to hide our physique or change how we look. We can embrace all of who we are without comparing ourselves to anyone else.\u00a0We can be real and we can own it. All of it. Every last badass bit.
Like any relationship, friendship changes over time. Things like marriage, job relocations, parenthood, and illness all can step in and change the nature of a friendship. Even the most resilient friendship can change over time. But sometimes, if we're really lucky, we have that one friend  with whom the bond is just as strong now as ever. Our BFFs. Besties. Friends for life.

It may seem strange that writing about playing like a kid is part of a series of blogs about sex, but let's face it, sex is just another form of play.  Sure, it's adult play, but if you've forgotten how to play like a kid, my guess is that you're not maximizing the potential for enjoyment in your sex life. At least I certainly wasn't.
Want to know how to get over that? How to get over the \I could never try that?\ Have a staring contest with fear. Promise yourself whoever blinks first is the loser.
Some of the most gigantic things I've done, for myself or my career, were truly unplanned. And I didn't, at first or for a while, know what the heck I was doing. Sometimes, I still don't. But I think that's okay. I don't think you have to know. I think you just have to do.
When I was around 9, I hatched a plan to get my reading done and still watch my cartoons. I decided to memorize my entire reading book! I took the time to practice for weeks until I got it right.
Don't minimize the precious child she has lost by saying she can always have another child, she was \only\ at 10 weeks, or at least she has another child. She is grieving a life that lived inside of her -- for however short a time -- and that life and loss deserves honor and respect.
Staying calm is the key to getting what you want from a complaint. You are well within your rights to suggest how someone could rectify a situation, but by keeping your suggestions realistic, you stand a much greater chance of having your wishes fulfilled.
Here are four steps to take to feel better about your work.The first two are short-term strategies, while the last two are long-term game plans.
After 12 years in the design industry, James is leaping into the entrepreneurial world with me -- something that was an enigma to him up until very recently.
Journaling is an excellent habit to incorporate into daily life, and vacation gives you ample time to dive deep into your thoughts and emotions, unfiltered and without daily obligations tugging at your sleeve.
We understand the danger of texting while driving, yet we knowingly overload our brains with multiple tasks that lead us to a cluttered life and a growing list of unattainable daily demands.

No, I was not offended that you did not find me attractive, because my value is not determined by how attractive you find me. You do not get to decide what offends me -- I decide my own value.
There are a few reasons I choose to be anonymous with my religion. I don't need to talk about my religion or get people to convert to my side. I don't need to debate the merits of my religion versus another religion or having no religion at all. I know what I believe and I'm firm in my faith. I have no desire to make sure you believe what I believe or to give you some spiel on why I needed to change religions.
You wouldn't think much has changed since turning 25. You would probably think the two ages are one in the same because in a way, they are (for example


Many women like how they look in heels. They shouldn't be made to feel as if they're abandoning the feminist cause, or kowtowing to the patriarchy if they choose to wear them. It's possible to want to wear high heels and also want equality in the workplace at the same time.
When making a decision, it often feels like there are only two options. In less thoughtful moments, I have chosen based only on the options presented, but in more thoughtful moments, I have come to understand a third option.
From unattainable beauty standards placed on women to how inaccessible birth control remains to having men debate whether you are good looking enough for TV, it is safe to say that we have found our new feminist best friend.
My empty ring finger now defines me more than my irrepressible desire to become something great. Gone are the days when people wanted to know what I yearn to achieve.
Winning someone's heart doesn't require employing a lot of complicated schemes. You're more likely to find lifelong love by listening to your instincts and sticking with what works.
We all have unique gifts and talents, whether we've manifested them or not. It's vital to make a commitment to discover these talents and follow our dreams and passions -- not someone else's. Therefore, our first step should be to define what success means to us as individuals.
I want our generation to be the last one to grow up knowing structural and cultural barriers that hold women back. I want our daughters and sons to be able to choose the same college courses and pursue the same careers -- for the same pay.
The struggle between femininity and feminism is real, my friends, and even in this new millennium of progression and open mindedness, it still very much exists. Here are my current feminist struggles, and I'm sure you have way more to add to this list as well.
Part of growing up is learning that maybe all your dreams won't come true, no matter how hard you work or how much you want them. And an even bigger part of growing up is learning to accept this, move past it -- and, ultimately, find something new to immerse yourself in.
Welcome to 2015, where women are some of the most powerful executives in business, women are regularly dominating in school, and a woman is a serious candidate for the presidency of the United States. Welcome to the future, where women are more.
If you are feeling stressed, overcommitted and worn down, I am going to encourage you to take a look at your schedule and, more importantly, how often you are saying \yes\ to things out of obligation, guilt or fear.
Worldwide, preterm birth is the primary cause of death among children under five, often happening in the first month of life. Fifteen million babies are born early every year, with most of those births occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
When I see the Memorial Day photos of Arlington, I know those simple white markers represent entire lives. They are the boys running across a soccer field, the kid bagging your groceries, the girls playing varsity volleyball -- every one of them somebody's child who had an entire life of promise ahead.
With the very sad news that B.B. King, the king of blues, passed away I was reminded of a pretty epic story where my dad taught me a hugely important life lesson. Way back when, when my dad and I were on the college tour driving from school to school, a B.B. King song came on the radio.
Planning to teach Wharton soon, I took another look at Franzen's New Yorker hatchet job on Edith Wharton, and it was worse than I remembered. The critics' darling praises her classics The House of Mirth, The Custom of the Country, and The Age of Innocence but grossly misreads her character and her life.

During a summer weekend, many of us look forward to family activities, going to a beach, eating good food, or maybe just catching up on Mad Men. (Don't spoil the finale for me!) But while you are enjoying your leisure time, you can also be networking. Here are three tips to incorporate networking into your summer weekends!

I was often the largest woman in the room, but off the mat, I was welcoming in my own revolution of body acceptance. I decided to feel more committed to my own well-being than to a number on a scale. As I went deeper into yoga, I went deeper into the connection with my body.


The Dad Bod lays out what is acceptable for men and women. It reinforces the gender inequality that is present in our societal perceptions of body image.
Leading a double life wasn't exactly the hardest thing in the world, but it wasn't easy. I didn't feel embarrassed about my serving job, but I was self-conscious about the different personalities I needed to uphold at each role.
The concept that women could do it all was alive and well as I transitioned from student to working adult. And as a young, na\u00efve woman looking for a way to bring it all into my life, I fell for it hook, line and sinker. Why can't women have it all?
The Internet can be intrusive, yes, but it can also be a voice of comfort -- and, in my case, a close friend leaning in to whisper, \You know how you thought your dad was the greatest guy in the world? You were right. Let me tell you why.\


Your longtime love sees you through a filter of loving timelessness. They know that your soft tummy was caused by growing their babies, the lines by your eyes the product of shared laughs. To be middle-aged and single can be rather awkward, especially if you can't laugh about it.


We decided to conduct an experiment where he would plant a very bold Hollywood-style kiss on me when he arrived home for dinner. This dramatic entrance kick-started the trajectory and was silly enough to throw me off my typical rejection response.
Until that February evening, I had never known of the pain that screams from the earth in that small village in the mountains of Caucasia.
Just like tiny raindrops, there are small things you can do every day to fill up the reserves. The more drops or positive things you pour into the relationship, the more cushion you have for the dry spells. The result is a strong foundation of trust, love and patience.

This \Feminist Fad\ embodies all the wrong things for the right reasons. I am all for the courage of conviction, for women to earn their just rights, but it's gone too far. It's about responding rationally to injustices, not reacting. Saying you are a feminist can't make you a cool kid, but being one in every action every day, this is what makes a true feminist.
Having lunch at a Panera in New Jersey, Zoey Mendoza Zimmerman could be your fun neighbor; the one who organizes all the cool parties, and knows the best gossip. Talking about her life after the murders, she says, shaking her head, \I'm living a Lifetime Original Movie. How did this happen?
Like the monsters who lived under many of our beds when we were kids (mine was an alligator!), when we turn on the light, the monster magically disappears. I know this, but gosh! It's hard to do when you're scared. To \turn on the light\ on a ferocious, scary problem, there are five steps brave grown-ups can take.
As long as infertility is only a women's disease, the burden of infertility is unequally distributed. As more men speak up about their challenges with trying to conceive, women and men will feel even more supported and encouraged. And less alone.
Remember getting praised for small victories? Think about the fact that at one point, someone actually congratulated you for going to the bathroom and finishing all your dinner.

When you're an adolescent, coming into your teen years sounds awesome. We wake up every morning pick out outfits based on how we feel that day, or consider the thought of grabbing the attention of a cute boy at school. Life is so easy for us then.

I always tell my clients who are challenging themselves to connect with others and date like never before -- if you feel uncomfortable, that's a good sign! That discomfort is where the magic lies. And besides, it won't feel uncomfortable for long. And when you find love, it will have been well worth it!
I don't know about you but I would love 8 million dollars right about now. I would consider my own self crazy if I turned down a deal like that. However, unlike most, Mayweather saw the bigger picture for his dream and his career. I'm sure in that season of his career as he came closer to making his decision and even made the bigger announcement Mayweather:

Ultimately, I think being an adult isn't any one age or any one thing. It doesn't mean that you don't lean on other people when you fall. It just means that you count on yourself first and foremost and don't expect anyone else to clean up your mess for you.
If you take the pledge to be healthier this week, we're asking that you also take the time to think about the health of children and mothers who are facing hard economic realities and the health consequences of those circumstances.
I am losing weight so I can hike with my kids by Mother's Day.  I am having back to back Tinder dates because I am finding My Person this year. I am studying Math 101 so I can feel smart.  I am reading this book so I do not get kicked out of bookclub.  I am dancing so I can feel the Angels when I move.
The long goodbye is often used to describe the drawn out fading of a person's mind, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. But for my mom, it was because of Hepatitis C.


Do you ever wonder if you sometimes keep yourself small because you are afraid of your actual power? Do you ever wonder if you silence yourself and mute your opinion so that you will be \likeable\ and not mistaken for a \bitch\? Do you ever wonder what it would be like to actually own your power?
The plight of nail salon workers sits at the intersection of the environmental, economic and reproductive justice and immigrant rights movements.
States should recognize that providing comprehensive dental care is in the best interests of both mother and infant, and advocates should work to educate people about their coverage options. On this Mother's Day, let us acknowledge that the life of a healthy child starts with a healthy mother. Let's give mothers and children a Mother's Day gift of health, including healthy teeth.
Motherhood is a full-time job, and this mom is clearly working overtime to build her family empire. I had the honor of interviewing Nascar team owner Melissa Lebron. Melissa Harville-Lebron is the first African American NASCAR woman team owner.
Over the past five years of living with mom's dementia, I have seen time and time again that despite the complete confusion and craziness that comes with this disease, my mom's brain may not remember the details, but her heart always does.
In the last 15 years, we have seen a number of media waves on this topic. In the big picture, we've seen an ascent of talk about this in the public sphere since the 70s. That's over four decades. Where are we after 40+ years of talking about the childfree choice? Let's start with a quick broad stroke look back in time.
The joy I feel in being a regular person in my full-time job and not a trophy employee for some disgustingly inappropriate male boss, shouldn't be uncommon -- it should be the standard. But being a \body\ instead of a worker has been a common instance for me in my employed life.
There are a lot of us recovering achievement junkies out there in the world. Maybe you are one too? Here are a few of the signs that you are part of our club
Men, including my husband, my bikini isn't for you. Yeah, you might notice me, but as long as you don't harass me, I don't care.
Holding compassion as a higher value than revenge, spite or fear may take some getting used to, but it is ultimately the one emotion that can see you safely through troubled waters.
In 2015, people wore jeans that fit like leggings and tucked them into boots. And some of these boots didn't go above the ankle.
Tiffany started her website for $3,000 and believes that just about anyone can save this kind of money to have an app built or a website built. She encourages women to start their own businesses and learn tech. Here are her top five tips to get started.
In major cities, car-hailing apps like Uber, Lyft, and SideCar are quickly becoming the most reliable form of transportation. With their ubiquity also comes the possibility of a missed connection
The movie has sent a pretty clear message to viewers that men are by nature sexual and aggressive, and women should relent, know their place and not \try too hard.\
I loved the Avon travel suitcase with its rows of compartments containing miniature lipsticks, nail polish bottles and sample packets of Skin So Soft oils. The lipsticks were the perfect size for me and my sister to play with and put on our baby dolls.


How long have they loved and been immersed in one another? A lifetime? I am envious of that. I didn't get that with my person I chose to I Do with. Or maybe they met on a seniors dating AP. Maybe he went to war and he asked for her hand to be married before he left, to have a photo and a ring to keep him alive while bombs flew. I wish I had asked them, their story.
It has been almost seven years since she had passed. Her presence is sorely missed. And yet her legacy -- the life of a woman, a mother, of dignity and youth --  lives on. Colors fade as life perishes but they stay as beautiful, like old rose.
Support from the U.S. provides mothers with the extra help they need to protect their children and changes millions of lives for the better. Perhaps no issue better illustrates this than the U.S.'s leadership on HIV and AIDS.
We salute your courage to bridge the stereotypes with non-conventional ideas and as you continue to do so, we hope that you are rejuvenated by those who hold you near and dear on this special day!
Today on Mother's Day, we need to confront the truth that the United States doesn't do that well by mothers and consequently by children. It isn't simply that the PDA isn't as strong as it should be; mothers face many obstacles in the American workplace from pregnancy to childbirth and beyond.
While I'm a huge advocate of millions of women sharing their infertility stories... I strongly believe your Mother's Day misery does not need more company. Save the commiserating for a day that's not all about celebrating moms. But this Sunday? Let's find some cool ways not to be hot and bothered.
Women are told that they can do it all. They can have a profession, a family, and a life of their own. They can be engineers, CEOs, even fight for our country on the front lines during war. Yet, tributes to motherhood neglect ways in which they can honor the diversity that motherhood has come to represent.

I actually wanted him to hit me. That would cross the line and give me the reason I needed to break up with him.
Love presents so many chances for overwhelming pain, and also for captivating joy. It's a double-edged sword that can release your innermost desires and also your deepest fears.

My mother had a fierce drive, a value in accuracy, a keen ability to listen and a unique gift of being able to create effective solutions to challenging problems
I will never stop missing him. I will never stop thinking about him. I will try to remember how he smelled like the Irish Spring soap he showered with, how his long toes looked more like fingers, and I will always remember how our time together was filled with lots of laughter and affection.
Achieving gender equality requires determined action at all levels. It is important to focus not only on ensuring that women can participate in the decisions which affect their lives, but also on eliminating discriminatory institutions, attitudes and practices.
If Beyonc\u00e9 wants to call herself a feminist she cannot attend, endorse and help to fund two men who disrespect women and their rights. She did indeed look stunning that night, but I wish she had shown off her outfit and beauty at a different event.
A year later, I have added a bunch of new mantras to my playlist.  The voices in my head are still funny and sarcastic, but I love them the most when they channel their sassy and sexy sides and whisper things like \Go ahead, you have time for a little unexpected pleasure right now.\
\As the oldest in my family, I had the privilege of watching my mom raise my four brothers and sisters, work full-time as a teacher,and earn a graduate degree. Her tireless example taught me the value of hard work.\
I sat down and wrote myself a letter. It didn't start out that way. I had intended to do some release work and write a letter to my ex. But as I wrote, I realized the person that needed to hear this most was me.

In today's Jam Session, Caroline and I jammed on how women can empower themselves to deal with bad bosses. We riff on being clear about your career goals, how upper-level management and bosses contribute \brain drain\ and what they can do to retain great talent.

If my heart's chosen one -- who should probably hurry up -- attempts to propose to me in any of these ways, I will kick him out of the house.
A lot of powerful brands have taken a stance against the volatile direction in which the media has led the definition of what it means to be beautiful, and it has been a wonderful shift, one that we continue to celebrate, thanks to campaigns like Dove's Love Your Body, and Lane Bryant's #Imnoangel. But have we lost sight of the most important message?
Here is my truth. I. Am. Enough. I have been and will always be enough. Instead of spending all of this energy on being someone I am not, I can rest in the fact that I am Erin, and I am enough.
A new study's key findings make clear that women are now overwhelmingly the healthcare decision makers for both themselves and their families. They are setting healthcare agendas, making treatment decisions, selecting healthcare coverage and providers.
The question
Too hot for one role, not hot enough for the other and I say

The empowerment concept gives life to the idea that a woman can be an agent of change in her own life, determining her own future. But defining empowerment is nearly impossible. The way we see others, and ourselves, is subjected to our own life experiences, perspectives, culture and values.
Here are my go-to favorite strategies to shift from a place where you're always reacting to a place where you respond and are in greater control of your day. Because the more you feel in control the more time and space you clear for fun, inspiration and joy.

Maybe that's what being middle-aged is all about... reaching the tipping point of self-actualization where you are like, \Oh, screw it. This will have to do.\
I have long been impressed by Yvonne Barteau. She is not only one of the nation's most accomplished dressage riders, but as a Post-50 woman, she continues to excel as a performer and trainer.

If you have not already done so, now is the time to talk to your son, your daughter, or your best friend and tell them if they are sexually assaulted that you will be there to support them.
As we prepare to celebrate \Mothering Sunday,\ remembering those women who have nurtured us along our path, one way to honor them is to make sure they avoid -- or survive -- heart disease.
Regardless of how we feel about people who are in prison, children have a right to see, to touch, and to speak with their parents (obviously, provided doing so poses no risks for the child).
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for feel-good tactics that brighten up the world. I only find it surprising that, despite all the books and essays and TV talk shows that tell people to love themselves, we still find it difficult to do.
The truth is that you can be any kind of woman that you want to be and still be a strong woman. You do not have to sort through stereotypes and decide which one to put on each day. You can love Shrek, foster kittens, read Nicholas Sparks books and be a strong woman.


The daughter in me realizes that this is considered uncommon and for some even weird. The mother in me asks, \why is it so strange to want to work with your mother?\ What is it about the mother/daughter relationship that makes our situation considered so unique?
It's an interesting experience, this being the partner with lower desire in a long-term relationship. In my case, the way this played out over two decades is that I fell into a routine of only having sex with my husband when he initiated.
Should you marry that guy? Should you take that job offer in Seattle? Should you go back to school? For many people, important decisions like these are sources of dread and anxiety. They dominate our thoughts during the day and keep us up at night.
It's amazing what can happen when we are finally faced with something we've long been anticipating. Sometimes we realize why we yearned for it in the first place, and sometimes it becomes clear it's not actually what we wanted at all.
While I only had the courage to slip my bottoms off once in Spain, beneath the water, for about seven seconds, the truth is that it didn't take long for me to get used to the idea of letting the girls fly free. It felt so much better -- less sweaty, more breezy and a helluva lot more fair.
But what actually happens here? What does it mean to have an experience in which one engages in unwanted sex, but does not feel explicitly forced into the sex act? And why had 100 percent of women I spoke with experienced this?

Everyone needs a rhymes-with-bucket list! Because bucket lists themselves can be kind of intimidating. All those things you have to do. Man, it's exhausting. And as the years pass and you fail to check off a single item? That bucket list can start to make you feel like crap when you get out of bed in the morning. It can taunt you a little.
She didn't choose this battle. But I promise it messed with the wrong woman. Give 'em hell George. We're praying and pulling for you.
If a former runaway teen with decades of anger and distance and thousands of miles between her and her father could find her way back to a lonely old man in a wheelchair finally ready to talk to anyone who wants to listen, anyone can bridge the gap.

After realizing last week that, as a woman, I apologize for nearly everything and to nearly everyone, my first instinct was to ask Google why. I typed the words \why do women,\ but before I could add \apologize,\ I was amazed at what Google suggested I ask instead.
I feel my hair bounce like a Breck commercial as I smile at puppies and passers-by. I imagine myself as the Italian girl walking through Florence in the black and white poster that hung in so many college dorms. That I look nothing like a hair model or 20-year-old Italian is moot. The sun on the street mirrors my mood and I give thanks to the great gift of time.
Girls of any age who were brought up on a steady diet of rom-coms and Jane Austen have dreamed about meeting The One since we were old enough to play with Barbie. There's that glance from across a crowded bar. The soundtrack. The meet-cute with snappy dialogue.
When we think of knitting, most people imagine their grandmother in a rocking chair hunched over a pair of needles. But there's something to be said for this meditative DIY craft. While Blake Lively took some time off after becoming a new mom, she found inner peace in knitting. Can you imagine being in her knitting circle?
While I left law school armed with knowledge and enthusiasm, I had little in my arsenal to prepare me for the realities of balancing work and life. If I could give these students some career guidance, I thought to myself, I would say the following.
In retrospect, bed rest turned out to be not all bad. In fact, it helped me become the successful entrepreneur I am today.
When I went with my husband to a sex and relationship coach for the first time, I was really nervous. My desire had been much less than my husband's for well over a decade and I didn't even know how to begin the conversation.
All the women in my life are smarter and more hardworking than men. They take on more responsibility and claim no credit for all their work. They are caring, compassionate and willing to sacrifice their needs for others. Aren't these qualities that we would look for in a President?
This day, when girls were seen and heard, changed many lives, as I've come to know through the years. The program also brought about an amazing bond between fathers and daughters who spent the day in the place where those dads spent most of their waking lives.
Nope, Hillary wasn't the first. Before her there was Victoria C. Woodhull. I hear you asking, \Victoria who?\ Most people haven't ever heard of this 19th century female suffrage icon, but she was a revolutionary woman before her time. Here are seven things she can teach us about being strong, modern women.
Think of your knowledge or service as a product in your local grocery store. Can you imagine the owners allowing people to help themselves to cakes hot from the oven? Of course not!
The sight of pregnant women and small children was too much for me; I left their presence in tears. But it was when my mother refused to allow me to visit because she \needed to build a relationship with the one who could still give her grandchildren\ that I felt truly broken.
I want you to know that you are not alone. There's millions of us going through similar situations. None of us have the exact same circumstances but we can all relate and we all understand.

This time, for example, the Royal baby buzz doesn't seem to be as fevered as it was the first time round, or maybe it is just where I am. I have gotten to the phase of my recovery where seeing babies no longer breaks my heart.


As women grow up, society tumbles us and shapes us. We are supposed to be thin, but not too thin; smart, but not too smart; maternal, but sexy. Impostor syndrome is the result. You end up feeling that you don't, actually, belong anywhere. The first step to remedying this issue is recognizing it.
There have been long strides made in the past decade in the aforementioned areas, and there are more strides to be made by policymakers and the youth alike. However, Washington can no longer overshadow the youth voice with its constant bickering and gridlock partisanship.
Just as the MDG's are sustained through country partnerships and collaboration, the same could be said for strengthening and revitalizing our communications partnerships in organizations of all sizes and budgets, to ensure clarity, unity and power of messaging.

Ellen Pao's lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins vividly illustrates how CEOs and business leaders are scrutinized online in a way most of us will never be. Every day, the players in this case are the subject of articles, commentary and speculation.
We think we need to move the debate even further so we can try to tackle these challenges and at this moment, we have a golden opportunity to do that.
I was a woman, I was pregnant, I wasn't even old enough to legally rent a car, and I had scored higher on their aptitude entrance test than any other candidate.
New York-based writer/performer Aizzah Fatima produced a one-woman comedy show called \Dirty Paki Lingerie\ as a result of her growing frustration with the limited perception other have of her as a refugee or a victim.
We are all unique and have different gifts to share, but \specialness\ is not just bestowed upon only a chosen few.
At SXSW, where apps such as Meerkat sparked industry buzz, The Ipsos Girls' Lounge brought female founders together to help guide new tech startups. We dug into the bias that may be holding female entrepreneurs back and shared insight to help them win the pitch.
She is a leader who won't back down. At the pinnacle of her global recognition, now Hillary is seeking to make history with seeking again the highest job in the land. She is a resilient female leader.
What makes you happy? This question is not as easy as it might seem.
The much-anticipated release of the Fifty Shades of Grey movie and its novel series precursor struck chords of concern among women's health advocates. While the book sold over 100 million copies worldwide and has been heralded as an erotic romance novel that is sexually liberating, the nature of the protagonists' relationship is troubling because of its multiple aspects of domestic violence.

Kathrine Switzer became the first female to officially enter and run.  The photo of a race official forcibly attempting to stop her and grabbing for her race numbers was the photo shot heard round the world.  Life magazine listed the photo as one of the \100 Photographs That Changed The World.\
I'm super aware of how mean I can be to myself a lot of the time and I'm constantly trying to battle the bully in my head that reared its head at a young age. I recognize that sometimes the things that can ruin my day by making me feel fat are so beyond ridiculous that I have to laugh at them.


Women need to encourage, mentor and challenge other women. Despite what hardships they may have experienced in their own careers, women should pull other women up with them, rather than paying the hardship forward.


I've been with my husband for 20 years. And we've had a pretty awesome marriage by most measures. But they say you'll either fight about sex or money. And for us, it wasn't money.
Today, April 14, 2015 is Equal Pay Day, which marks the point in the present year when women earn the same amount as men did in the previous year. Here at home, the local Lean In DC Circle is working with local businesses to give women a 22 percent discount. People are ready to take action -- and with good reason!
Attention to detail matters. Make sure that your shoes are polished and that the soles don't have holes (they can be visible when your crossing legs). If wearing high heels, make sure you can walk steadily up and down stairs as well as some distance (like the equivalent of a long hallway).
My old agency director? He could have been imprisoned for what he said to me. That was almost 20 years ago, but I will never forget his words and their after effects.
How often is a small town girl from Ohio confronted with an opportunity to show her son what making a movie is all about?  NEVER!  So I thought... what the heck, why not?  We spend most of our weekends watching movies, why not be in one?

I read that a former classmate's husband had died. I had had no contact with her for many years but made a point of sending my condolences. She wrote back how important it was to have heard from me. When I see her at our next reunion, we will reconnect better because of my note.
You can still dream together, talk about getting older together and even hope to move near each other again and then reminisce about that again a week later.
I didn't want the girls to worry about me, just to understand that grief spools out, that it's a rare day that I do not think about this young woman so many people loved and feel an ache. I want them to know that we are allowed to be sad, that feelings ebb and flow forever.
I'm the type of woman you might think would fare just fine if she skipped her yearly checkup. But I never have -- a simple fact that saved my life.
But if you're anything like me, you may be shifting gears as part of your midlife assessment. Are you changing careers? Getting divorced? Moving? And though those tried-and-true friendships are invaluable in so many capacities, you may be feeling an itch to engage with like-minded folks who are also embracing big change.
I now know that when I am turn 50, I will look at photos of me at 40 and see a stunning woman. What does this mean? It means I am beautiful today. And so are you
I invite all of you to let down your own walls. The ones you may have built around your heart to avoid pain. That is an impossible dream. Move forward with courage and abandon. Trust that the next time will be different. The mystery of what the universe has in store for you next awaits you.

I wish you all a beautiful magical love that you deserve. It is out there for all of us. But we have to fall in love with ourselves first. We have to let go of old unhealthy behaviors, beliefs and patterns about others, and ourselves. We have to open up completely and know ourselves well before we can give ourselves to another,
When 26-year-old Alex Fine was fired from her job at a skincare company, she took it as a sign to flesh out an idea that had been rolling around in the back of her mind
So far, I have not been blessed with daughters, only sons. But I wonder how would I greet a baby girl knowing the inequality she'd face? How would I advocate for her? It's often said that sexism is the most subtle and evasive form of discrimination.
When I was eight years old, I rushed into the kitchen afflicted with a cut on my wrist. She cocked one eyebrow, looked down her glasses and calmly responded in her Southern drawl to the screaming child in front of her. \Well, you're not deaaaaad yet.\
I used to be intimidated by people who wrote about sex, even long after I started writing about it myself. The irony, of course, is that people now think the same thing about me. That because I write about sex, I must be particularly sexual. To which my internal response is

\Hippy,\ she said. \This one's got some hips on her.\ She continued to pull and sigh and make small laboring noises as she worked. I sought out my mother's eyes, but she didn't seem to notice where Eugenia's remark had landed.

Many women with eating disorders, including models, partake in dangerous tactics to maintain a slimmer physique -- yet aren't underweight by BMI standards. In some ways, focusing on \the numbers\ perpetuates the damaging notion that they matter most.
Asking for mentorship can be scary, but what's the worst that can happen, someone will say no? I guarantee you that if you search and ask enough, someone will say yes. Be fearless, be bold and go after what you want. You deserve it.


The daughter of a free white man and an enslaved black woman, she sued for her freedom. Through petition, her case was sent to the Virginia General Assembly and she was freed in 1656.
Even if we're not in love, it can be hard to walk away from something, however imperfect, when loneliness is the other option. If you're beginning to realize the relationship you're in is headed for a dead end, here are a few tips to help get you through the worst of it.
Although the fear and confusion of that moment have since faded, the profound sense of loss lingers very close to the surface and that's okay. It's okay to be sad about losing something you didn't want. It's natural to be frustrated when your right to a decision was bypassed.

Challenge and controversy is a big slice of the leader's pie. People watch how you handle yourself and adversity.
Hi. My name is Lucinda Cross, and I am a former procrastinator. I am 10 years clean from procrastination. Please join me for a moment of silence followed by the Serenity Prayer which we will recite.
Just last year, Smith went missing for nearly 18 hours -- and was later found in Manhattan. Her struggle with the disease continues, yet she and Gasby have not only been devoted to each other, but to the cause.
I'm well aware that Leslie Knope is a fictitious character. However, through Amy Poehler's enthusiasm and witty inclusion of feminist principles, Leslie is brought to life.  Leslie Knope is the complete embodiment of feminism.
When you can see what's happening in your mind and your body -- oh, my heart rate is going up, and my thinking is getting a little cloudy -- you can take a step back from it, rather than getting carried away by it.
I believe these seemingly harmless social norms serve to send a mixed -- and ultimately harmful -- message to men. When it comes down to it, how can we as women demand equal wages when we also expect to be paid for?

When the blizzard is done and I fire up my snowblower, there is a real feeling of regaining a bit more control over my world. Seeing a clean sidewalk due to my efforts that has been carved out of the elements gives me great satisfaction.
When it was over and he was snoring loudly on the couch while I lay shivering on the floor, the last thing I thought was sexual assault.

Maybe it's because I'm currently working from Los Angeles, the mecca of discriminating in the name of social demand, or maybe it's because I've heard this phrase at least a dozen plus times this week alone -- but can we talk about the term \basic b*tch,\ please?
I thought more about the word. It's everywhere. Often not even beeped out of television shows, \bitch\ is in rap songs and pop songs and on t-shirts. \It's Britney, bitch.\ \I'm in Miami, bitch.\


Nowadays our endless amount of choices, make us feel like there's so many options, we can't even commit to a date. We're always looking for the next best thing. Today's society is as confused as ever.
Born and raised in China, Pocket often heard her father often say, \Create jobs for people, instead of waiting to get a job from them.\ And while female entrepreneurship has become more visible in China these days, entrepreneurship wasn't a path she wanted to pursue as a twenty-something.

I was the first female CEO in the top 25 research companies. When I sold my company, I worked with all VC guys. They ran a company built with numbers; I ran a company built with passion. They rewrote my pitch deck, because I was told, \This is how you do it.\

I am a mother; I am a mechanic; I am a plumber; I am a landscaper; I am a caretaker.
If the fictional world of film and TV shows a landscape of female characters who are diverse, who have\u00a0 unique attributes, who are CEOs and doctors and scientists -- how will that inspire our children? Will our children expect women in leadership roles? It should then be normal.
For me, Spelman College is more than an academic institution. It is the place where I first tasted the freedom to be myself without the fear of rejection or judgment. Spelman has become my North Star.
Healthy Lily James may be, but that is not the message that girls are receiving -- not from the plain, old images they see and certainly not when they hear that an already thin woman needed to avoid food to fit into a costume.

If you're looking for a man, look no further. I'm here with the definitive list of men you'll find at what I like to call, \Disneyland for those with dietary restrictions.\

What if we collectively, as women, stopped viewing the unrealistic images of women's bodies we see daily in the media as being normal and beautiful and started giving our bodies the love we so readily and unconditionally give everyone else in our lives?



In the last five years, our relationship has been many things






There's no shortage of stories of the careers that have been launched, or significantly propelled, during the three-week mega-event that is SXSW. If you're in Austin this month, here are a few of the female trailblazers you'd be lucky to meet.
Why has #FatisNotaFeeling inspired such rage from the Internet trolls? Why are the women behind it meriting hate blogs and Internet stalkers? We're talking about a Facebook emoticon, here -- not a federal law or a constitutional amendment.




Yet even with the space she gave me, I still felt suffocated. Like I was choking on my father's memory. And I was. My father haunted me long before he died.




Because women matter, and public health is not just a feminist's cause. When half of our population isn't taken care of, we all pay, whether it's financially or in other ways.


To turn to the real world, it is not uncommon to find households in which one parent dominates another. The power play in turn impacts the children.


Well, now I look in the mirror and ask the hard questions.  I separate the important from the unimportant; the real from the fake; the benefit of the doubt from the judgments, the love from the darkness. And I make a choice.
As women break barriers and crack glass ceilings in countries like the U.S., in much of the developing world, women and girls still face staggering challenges to their health and well-being. This week seems like the right day to recognize three of them.
At age 7, I began counting calories and lost seven pounds. I remember that number, because I had apparently done better than my grandmother, who had also recently gone on a diet.
Is it because women aren't being considered for the international assignments, or because they aren't taking them?
A stay-at-home mom is sometimes considered anti-feminist, but what's really anti-feminist is thinking that women are incapable of making their own life choices, whether that be staying at home and raising a family or pursuing a career or some combination of the two that works for them.
Taking a deep breath, I unsnapped my bra. Eila leaned in close. I could practically feel her warm breath on the side of my chest, the place where \Lefty\ used to be. The place that was protected by a spray of persimmon-shaded flowers. \It's so beautiful,\ Eila said. And I believed her.




The following women are among the 15 candidates that you can vote on to be the face on the $20 bill. All 15 have been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame
When women's value proposition is actually met by their employers, their aspiration to a position of power soars -- enough, we hope, to blast past the fears and doubts that make the glass ceiling seem so impenetrable.
In my mind, every year of my life is an opportunity to learn more about who I am and what I want from this life. It also gets me closer to the age I've always wanted to be... 40.
Asking myself that question literally changed my life. In response, evidence that I was wrong about myself began to appear. I went from a \no-talent\ recovering lawyer to a person who made it my mission to uncover what talents I truly possessed.
We are still not doing enough to close the gender gap; it is girls in rural areas who will be the last to go school. The harsh reality is we cannot talk about the prosperity of women and girls in Africa if we don't tackle the reasons girls are discriminated against and made vulnerable to exploitation in the first place.
Rarely, if ever, do we ask how those women without high wages, paid leave, affordable child care, or flexible schedules juggle their desperate need to earn money with caring for their family. But this is the big question that we all should be asking, because it turns out that there are real consequences for all of us.
Today marks the 107th International Women's Day.  On this day, we recognize how far we've come in achieving critically important rights for women, but we must also acknowledge just how far we still have to go.
The idea for International Women's Day was born at a conference in Copenhagen in 1910. It sought to raise international awareness of the connection between all women and to bring attention to the cultural, social, and economic diversity of our lives.

My eating disorder was about everything and nothing. It brought up issues of control, self-loathing, perfectionism, and spiritual hunger. But it wasn't traceable to any of these things. And it certainly wasn't traceable to the desire to attract men.
Tackling this issue requires a change in a society's understanding of \what a woman can or can not do.\ Policies help. Signing treaties help. Yet, advocating a change in mentality requires reframing the conversation at the policy level.
As International Women's Day comes around, we have a lot to reflect on, but we must also remember women are not alone in our quest for justice. From Dhaka to DC, we are united in saying the rights that were denied to us will not be denied to our daughters.
One issue that people face around the world is gender stereotyping. Overly-simplistic generalizations based on gender cause us to misunderstand and devalue women and men
While I was used to a heavy workload, nothing prepared me for the demands of simultaneously running an organization and a household. I naively believed that during my maternity leave I could keep one foot at work while spending quality time with my family. I was wrong.
The shift to living virtually has happened so quickly and so pervasively, that we have hardly had time to adjust to all the implications. Just like every other sphere of life, crime too has gone online. And we are very poorly prepared.
John eventually voiced that he found the celebrity statement sick and that I was not being heard and the conversation shut down from there. Just like that, one man changed the flow of conversation.
After a breakup, the newly-single often hear two somewhat contradictory pieces of advice. First, there are the friends and family members who encourage the heartbroken to \move on.\ But there are also more philosophical types who will encourage the lovelorn to grieve. Which is better?

Cultivating resilience in the face of adversity is something a Jedi does quite well, and I am all about it.
The problem with a jalopy is that it breaks down. From time to time, the system falls apart. A child is sick, or a spouse or a parent. Or me.
It must be noted that the process of confidence and self-love is exactly that
I'm not going to lie and say I'm 100 percent happy with the way I've handled certain things in my life. Although there are not situations I necessarily wish I'd avoided, or wish hadn't been thrust upon me, there are situations I wish I had responded to differently.

As the feminist movement evolves, we must stay committed to not only seeking to raise the collective voice of women but also to ensuring that voice reflects the rich diversity of women.
It's not that I don't want children right now. It's not that I don't want children until after I'm married, or after I've paid off my student loan debt, or after I've bought a house. There is no caveat to this statement. I do not want children ever.
Let's seek what makes us happy. Let's kiss guilt and sacrifice goodbye. Let's fulfill our purpose. Let's make life worthwhile for we were born to be happy. Let's not pretend but act, let's not just live but be alive.
The way they dress, laugh and interact is not that far removed from my own teenage years -- they all have their own distinct personalities with an understandable dose of egocentricity, and some are better versed in social communication with adults than others.

I stopped playing the work-life-money game I had been raised with and decided that since this was my one life, I was not going to spend it working or living for the future. And over the course of the last seven years, I have been able to create a life that truly feels like I'm on vacation every day.
You've seen women in burqas, niqabs, and abayas on the news -- but how many do you actually know? And what is it like to wear one all the time?
It goes without saying that men and women are different in infinite ways. And it goes without saying that women can be a bit more verbal about how they are feeling.
I've been a breast cancer warrior for eight months, chemo and surgery behind me, radiation and hormone therapy around the corner. My battalion is made up of loving, brilliant, powerful, and hilarious soldiers who have made this journey one of thriving, not just surviving.
I've spent the last 10 years getting to know my feminist more. And you know what's weird? She's awesome. She's amazing. She's an amazing feminist person.
Our friendships are a reflection of who we are. As we are growing and evolving as human beings, we may realize that some aspect of ourselves is no longer serving us. As a result, we may find ourselves needing to let friends go as well.

There are instances when I'm not even thinking about how I look, what I'm wearing or how I am perceived because I am too busy living. And that is when my authentic self appears.

We are teaching women that they don't have to examine the affects of their abuse and work on empowering themselves. This doesn't break the cycle of gender-based violence in our culture. This perpetuates it. And that is not acceptable.
I was afraid to like myself. I had no idea how to love myself. The world couldn't know who I really was. If it did, then I'd feel even more rejected.
After accepting my diagnosis, anorexia seemed like the one special thing about me. \Recovery\ seemed synonymous with \fatness,\ \failure\ and \mediocrity.\ When my therapist threatened hospitalization, I lied, promising to gain necessary weight.


I remembered the several hours I had spent there during my own Columbia freshman orientation, back in 1996. I had awoken in the middle of the night pinned to my bunk bed by a man who breathed hotly on my face, promising we would \do it again soon.\
Strict sexual monogamy has always had more to do with property rights than with erotic pleasure. It's served us pretty well for thousands of years. But it's not exactly natural.
This movie, Fifty Shades of Grey, will challenge us. It will be a turning point. It will begin a fight for women in many ways.
The National Great Blacks in Wax Museum in Baltimore, Maryland honors African-American heroes and heroines. Match the following heroines with her accomplishment.

How do you celebrate four years sober from drugs and alcohol? For Ann Marie Jones, it is going to the courthouse to set up a payment plan for the thousands of dollars in court fees she owes after many years in and out of the criminal justice system.

Success, at home and in the workplace, requires us to take charge of our mindset and manage the negative thoughts and beliefs stored within
If girls that exhibit masculine tendencies are praised for their strength while boys that display more feminine interests are rejected, what are we teaching children about gender? At a young age, we are already showing children that traditionally feminine characteristics aren't valuable.
With all of the monumental heartache, building insecurities and irreparable damage that presents itself after such said rejection, there are still certain instances when you should welcome it -- actually, you should count your lucky stars that you dodged this destructive bullet and the Gods above threw you a bone.


The fact is, Susan B. Anthony was a remarkable woman, and  as February 15th was her birthday, it seems a good time to honor her lifetime of advocating for women's rights by sharing a bit about her in this week's post.
This myriad of online dating apps have given rise to a pick and choose shopping behavior that emphasizes looks more so than ever. We now browse potential suitors as if we're looking through a catalog, or better yet.. window shopping.
Sometimes we'll get it right and sometimes we'll mess up and have to start over. I know this because I have had the pleasure of meeting and interviewing hundreds of women from all across the country -- women who are trying to chart their own course.
Change won't happen if we just talk about it, it will only happen if we do something about it. Here are some key takeaways to bring to your workplace:
She tackles these double standards head-on, questioning the way we traditionally judge women. Leslie (and that sweet, sweet hubby Ben) show us how sexist assumptions make a mockery of not just women but men as well and ultimately act as a disservice to all of us.
Fans defend the film as providing fun, pure fantasy and a community, but as a couples counselor, sex therapist, and teen advisor for decades, I worry about take-away messages from the movie.  Here are my warnings.
A recent report explores public attitudes about gender and leadership with a particular focus on leadership in U.S. politics and business. It illuminates differences in attitudes among four generations of adults and gives us some clues as to the work that needs to be done for women.

Existing in a space is not a privilege -- it is a right. Treat it as such, and have the courage to stop apologizing for it.
You deserve love. Your thighs, big or small, deserve love. Unless you're a cold-blooded murderer or torturer of kittens. If either of those are the case, please carry on with self-loathing.
Some perceptions of disability and illness are too messed up and extreme for my liking. Persons living with these conditions are seen as really good or really bad, but there never seems to be a middle ground. This means that disability/illness status is used to judge our characters. Without further ado, here's the \good\ and the \bad\ of disability/illness perceptions.
Men who seek younger partners may be having problems aging and are trying to re-establish a connection with the culture of a younger generation.
This legislation not only attacks women's rights, but it discriminates against people with low income and impedes other healthcare services as well.


Being a feminist does not provide a \get out of racism free\ card, and that is the card Iggy has been playing over and over since her rise to fame, which a lot of folks seem to have a whole deck of, from dismissive reactions to Susan B. Anthony's racism to flippancy regarding Madonna's use of the N-word.
I sat there for a second, stunned. My menu was open; I had been thinking about eggs and hash browns (it's never too late in the day for those.) But suddenly, rather than eating, I wanted to punch you in the face and get the hell out of there.
This year for Valentine's I'm cooking myself a steak and pouring myself a glass of Merlot. I will cut into my steak, red and rare, decant my dark, rich wine, and this is its own bloody communion.
This was a good reminder to me about the importance of not judging a book by its cover. It was a good reminder that you can never really know where someone has been, what they're going through, or what they are working towards in their life.
You can't always trust that others will respect your boundaries after you state them. You have to be sure that you make actions that reinforce your boundary -- no matter how painful and difficult that might be.
Edith Wharton is not a writer you tend to think of on Valentine's day. Her marriage was unhappy and the affair she had in her forties was with a faithless cad (it was a secret until the 1970s).

Like anything transformational, self-compassion and self-love only come alive through practice. Here is my simple approach to this powerful practice -- culled from the amazing Self-Compassion authors I have mentioned in this post already. Check out these four steps...
Unlike other objects, diamond rings powerfully inculcate gender differences and sexual status. They say, \I am taken,\ and a large ring says, \I am taken by a rich man that would crush your man, Darwinian-style.\
So what actions lead to love? Here are three in honor of Valentine's Day, all based on fostering vulnerability. Before you run for the woods, hear me out.
What is an appropriate present for your 20th wedding anniversary? Over 19 years John and I had enjoyed dinners at our favorite sushi restaurant, weekends in Ojai, bonsai classes, the Cemetery of the Stars Tour. But facing year 20, I was stuck. Creatively challenged.

Pope's impeccable problem solving skills, assertiveness and unapologetic demeanor are traits that attribute to her success as a fixer. However, these qualities are typically not viewed positively when displayed by women. Yet, she is revered by those around her.
I am proud to admit that my fears were in vain and we are still in that happy place. Don't get me wrong it's not all unicorns and rainbows but it's so much more than business. And thanks to The Walking Dead we still have a mutual obsession.
There is nothing new, unique, or even creative about Fifty Shades of Grey. It's just the latest installment of pop culture messages that teach girls and young women that truly hot and irresistible love includes some element of violence and danger.
Talking about feminism and opening the door for discussion is the best way to get the ball of equality rolling down the rocky hill that is American society.



Both discovering what dating is again and experimenting with the gym and new workouts have a learning curve that requires trial and error. Here are nine ways they are extremely similar...

What would make this experience different? Why would this stick when nothing else really has? I kind of turned the tables and asked my new trainer.
Looking for love externally, and even finding someone who seems to adore you, can be a fleeting thing if you do not have a strong foundation of self-esteem. It is honoring of oneself that opens the door for another to truly do the same.
What if, instead of celebrating yourself on Valentine's Day, you just were yourself? What if you simply acknowledged that being alone on February 14 can be difficult? I'm not saying wallow in it. I'm saying acknowledge that it is hard.
While the roses, the chocolates, the teddy bears, and the love is nice, when it comes down to it, loving yourself is a gift unlike any other. And that's not to say that you can't spend your Valentine's Day loving yourself while you're in a relationship.
About a month ago, I told my man I was \not a Valentine's girl.\ I insisted no gifts and assured him we could stay home and order pizza. I did not care about Valentine's Day and I meant it. Yesterday I changed my mind. A little.

Not only has it introduced many people to the world of kink, it's given them a lesson in how\u00a0not\u00a0to write. And if a lack of literary merit didn't slow down sales, well, at least people can learn about the elements of style while being turned on by the elements of sadomasochism
Don't make Valentine's Day any bigger than it needs to be. Spend time doing something you both love without going above and beyond and stressing out. Invest in gifts that are priceless, from the heart, not the wallet. Instead, relax, have fun and simply enjoy each other.
Perimenopause is the time leading up to your final menstrual period and can last up to several years.



The world worked differently then -- how people met, how we kept in touch. Numbers on scraps of paper were easy to lose, but somehow, we still found each other.
No, I don't live in New York; I'm not competing for press; I'm not trying to be the most liked or endorsed. Sure, I still have moments of frustration, but I'm focused on me. And I can honestly say I've never felt more comfortable in my skin.




We would all love a formula for how to fall in love, and while I don't think the 36 questions are that, I do think they could be very useful for online daters.
Some men seem to be threatened that the childhood memories will be ruined or that a classic film will be emasculated. But there are at least 10 reasons that women will rock a remake of the 1980s classic in a demon and ghost-possessed 21st century.
Behind every individual, every person, every face, there remains a powerful story filled with struggles, triumphs, and experiences to be uncovered.  The secret to uncovering that story?  Perspective.
I'm a married, childless 28-year career-minded feminist and I already know I can't have it all... nor do I want it.

You expect your partner to take you to an overpriced prix fixe dinner in a place that looks like pink and red exploded everywhere and you'll be dreadfully disappointed if this doesn't happen. You don't care what it costs, or even if it's fun; you just want to see some streamers.
Sit on your partner's lap (or vice versa), place your mouths an inch apart, don't kiss and just breath in synch with each other (one in, the other out, etc.) while touching each other \like you've never felt another human body before.\
Don't fret this Valentine's Day. It's just a day. You are not less if you are alone. In fact, you can create a Valentine's Day date for yourself that requires only your attendance that can be fabulous. It is all in the power of your mindset, your attitude and how you perceive being single.

I can continue to take pleasure in small victories, moments, and search for beauty on daily basis. I can continue to love and to grow in that love -- what it means and how it can transform. And, above all, I can be grateful. I am here and I am alive and sometimes, more often than not, this is more than enough.
While the numbers are bleak, we need to be focused on how to drive change. As a female tech founder, I've seen many of the challenges firsthand and wanted to share the lessons I've learned along the way.

There are some things you can't share with strangers. But since we're friends, I wanted to let you in on a little known fact concerning my sex life.  It's a strange thing, but not in a urinate-on-you kind of strange. It's better described as peculiar.
The math is pretty simple
I write these blogs to help you, to make you realize that you're not alone in the way that you're feeling but that you don't have to feel the way you feel. You can change. Your life can be so much more than what it is.
Now more than ever, the world really is our oyster, and women are leaping on these opportunities. It's a leveling of the playing field that has been a long time coming, and a trend that shows no signs of dying out.
Our first love may not be our last love. But it's forever etched in our hearts. It's the reminder of the finest part of ourselves as we found unity with another. It's the template we seek to revisit.

The Bachelor is an impossible situation for women who don't know themselves and who aren't confident. Sharing deeply traumatic events too early when meeting someone may heal you, but it won't solidify the ground on which a lasting partnership can be built.

Recently, I took the time to reflect on this period and wrote down my key takeaways. One of my mentors, who happens to be my current boss, taught me to always present things in \threes\... so here goes...

So whether we are entrepreneurs, employees, stay-at-home mothers, students, relatives, friends, or business associates, as women, our genuine affinity to one another need not be the exception.  It should serve as the inspiration everyone else uses to reset their beautiful circles.



Each therapy session he would cross the boundaries a little bit more and each time, I told myself that it was me who had the problem. He was a professional with years of experience, education, and training. He knew what he was doing, and I was the one that needed help.

How do we get more women onto more boards? We should want this not because of some handout or some quota, but because they are well-qualified and will make contributions that will improve the functioning of the companies which they serve.
When it comes to reaching pay equity, the pace of change is glacial. Just how long will it take until we see equal pay? At this rate, it could be more than 100 years.
\You are exactly what he needs, so if he is ready, it will be perfect. If not, don't stay for the sex.\ Well... I stayed for the sex.

Put down your phones. Strike up a conversation. Your future love interest could be standing right in front of you...ordering a soy latte.


Let me suggest one area where the two parties should easily find agreement

I am a proud, big-haired girl. In photos, my head is usually double the size of anyone else's. Us curly-haired girls have some secrets (at least I do) that may surprise you when it comes to our hair care regimen.
As a concept, love has always fascinated me. The word itself is dull at best; one syllable, two vowels, four letters. But it's humanity's obsession, the one thing we crave more than wealth and power.

My friends? My true friends? I miss them. I think that these superficial conversations and check-ins which give me that false feeling of having connected with people are the reason I feel lonely and dissatisfied as I sit here at my desk.
Loving myself created space for others to love me. I realized quickly what I would not tolerate from others. People only treat us as good as we treat us. If we don't truly love us, we create an obstacle course for others on their way to loving us. We set the bar.
So what am I grateful for now my heart is almost healed from the end of a romantic relationship that moved my heart in a good way forever? I am grateful it happened at all for the heartbreak has brought as much love into my life as the relationship did and for both I say thank you.
Through this step-by-step process to creating meaningful and transformative goals for this next year, not only will you be superwoman at work, but you'll thrive in all areas of your life and realize the most fulfilling year of your life yet!
Yes, The Bachelor franchise is cheesy, unrealistic and arguably degrading to both men and women. BUT it's also highly entertaining and a perfect, fluffy-beach-read-visual treat.
There were moments during my drinking that I would stop and look at myself and wonder what I had become.
Ultimately, various cancer treatments from all over the world should be available and put into practice. Not for one minute did I want to do chemo, obviously. But within the span of one year something totally undetected became very palpable indeed.


As I looked at the photos, I realized that I found myself unable to relate to any of the adoptees who were searching for answers. They had clues and tidbits of information they could use to help locate their birth parents. If I were to create a poster, it would be empty.
It is time to be greedy and focus on YOU this year. Changing to this new mindset will not happen overnight but it can happen and should happen. It is time to tend to write the vision and make it plain. It is time to Activate your dreams and goals.

Clearly in denial, I put the purse over my arm and modeled it in front of the bathroom mirror. Soft leather, the right size, perfect. When I put the purse back on the kitchen counter, I realized my sweatshirt smelled like fish and chemicals. So did my hands.

When situations like these occur, we are all faced with a psychological challenge. I could have become really embarrassed and closed off and decided never to go out in public to prevent my leg or wig from falling off or to prevent hearing the words \she has no hands.\ But wouldn't that be avoiding life?
There's no doubt that sex is incredibly important to a good, healthy marriage, but man cannot live on lust fulfillment alone. Building your marriage on sex is like building it on the Louisiana bog of Naked and Afraid. It's bound to sink and someone's bound to be killed by a water mocassin.
Cancer is something that I did not worry much about. Heart disease and diabetes ran in my family. They concerned me. Cancer is like grief. You do not completely understand its stronghold until it knocks on your door.
Women can face barriers to achieving success in any sector of work and at any level of society. Therefore, we must ground ourselves in our values, potential to be change agents and being able to carry out a purpose in life.

The truth is that all we have at stake is a little rejection. I know first-hand how that stings. But I promise you, you can survive it. And you might be pleasantly surprised by what you get back.
Although it's still raw, there's a sense that a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and that maybe this is just what I needed to find something that is healthier for me -- physically and mentally.
The thinness I'd achieved came with its own brand of indignity. It was the fear of gaining back each pound, of proving myself a fail\u00adure, that plagued me. It was the fatness of my shadow that followed me into the dark alley of an eating disorder.

Now give the same bag of random items to some adults and they won't know what to do. They will begin searching the bag for instructions. Looking to see what should be done or how. There is no zest, no test just where are the instruction so I can do this the \right way.\

Let me be frank
When I got divorced in 2010, I had a chance to step outside this \don't get attached\ pattern as I reorganized my life. I began to invest more time in my surroundings so that they reflect a truer picture of who I am. As luck would have it, I met a creative new friend, my Lean In co-moderator Kaylynn, who is a fashion and photo stylist. Kaylynn helped me transform my home physically and insisted that I truly \move in.\
Start to become aware of your life and your emotions, without judgment. If scary or painful feelings come up, feel them and let them pass. Resist the urge to numb them with coffee, wine, your news feed or stale candy canes. It's time to stop numbing and start truly living.
I can personally admit that my racial, ethnic, gender, and religious identities play a role in my decision making. I cannot say that this is inherently bad, but it is something that all of us should be cognizant of while framing our opinions on controversial issues.
From cuttingly clever videos critiquing street harassment to downright offensive ones equating the female vote with wedding dress shopping (yes, that happened), 2014 ran the gamut between commendable and despicable.


The new year is almost here and along with it, the opportunity to set resolutions and create new habits.

I fell in love across the Atlantic in a country more beautiful than God himself while four months pregnant with another man's child.
Tired of hearing your mother ask you when you're going to find the right person and settle down? Try sending a holiday greeting like this. That'll keep your mom quiet.
Emily moved forward as if propelled by a mysterious force of desire. The lingerie department impressed her with its sublimity and grace. She swept past the Gilligan & O'Malley camisoles, robes and nightgowns in pinks and purples, nude Spanx shorts and bins of panties.
Shopping is analogous to active enrollment in the biggest ritual of social expectations there is -- The Holidays. And if you're single, holiday shopping can do a real number on you.
Fast forward to the present where women are now torn between having it, not having it, trying to have it or pretending to have it all. After all, nowadays if we are not leaning in and slow cooking at the same time, we definitely don't have it all, do we?
The trouble I seem to be experiencing is that, by identifying as a poet, I'm basically declaring that money and/or financial security are not my primary life pursuits. This can be a challenging conversational exchange to have on a date, depending on the goals and interests of the person sitting across from you.
And right before the flames would go out, if I let myself, I'd see our ghosts. Dancing in the corner, holding hands, tightly. Laughing, pointing to each house and telling each other stories of how life would be if, well, reality didn't so fervently want to disagree.



My bet is that 2015 is going to be a year when we see powerhouse women rise, not just to add to the dialogue, but to take action and effect change on issues that matter to women everywhere. Here's why.
Facebook is a fab outlet to connect with our friends, but it doesn't have to be the barometer of our worthiness anymore. We can live like we were meant to live -- fully, whole-heartedly and authentically. Let someone else keep up with the Joneses, because you're done.
If feminism is about gender equality, then it's time to redefine roles for both women and men. It means inviting men to have a seat at the table and opening up the conversation to include them
We think of friendship as a way of pampering ourselves. The truth is, we don't realize our desperate need for consistent, authentic connection.
Wanting money for money's sake is bad, but needing money to maintain a certain quality of life is good. But what exactly does that mean? What is this elusive future \life\? And just what does it cost to maintain it?
When K.V. Switzer filled out her application to run the Boston Marathon, she wasn't being secretive; that was how Kathrine Switzer signed her name. The first woman to run the Marathon, she had help in fending off the race official who tried to remove her.
Feminism doesn't mean I don't want to be a girl, or that I don't like traditional girly things. Feminism means I have a choice to do so, and a society where it is safe.
Get up off that fainting couch. You're about to become the Banksy of winter footwear.

I'm 32, unmarried, childless, living in sin with my boyfriend and am obsessed with my career, fart jokes and podcasts about murder. I'm also a bad cook, mouthy and disorganized. In the actual '50s, I probably would have been burned at the stake, or at the very least, prescribed some very fun pills.
Study after study confirms that women backstab, undermine and put down one another -- at work, in the PTA, out for drinks -- basically taking every chance they can to act out the movie Mean Girls long past high school.

There's no place like home for the holidays. You get off the airplane and into the backseat of your dad's car and say to yourself, \Why the heck did I ever leave this place?\ Everything is exactly how you remember it. Or so you think.
You told your friend it was nice to see someone like me buy vegetables \for a change.\ You know, because you have been shopping with me before to see what I buy. You also made the assumption that I do not care about my health.
Whether it's speed networking, happy hour or LinkedIn meet-ups, it's all equally annoying, particularly if no alcohol is involved. But like the savvy professionals we are, we must fake it until we make it, and leave our complaints at the check-in table... or if you're like me, right here.
Portraits in Leadership unveiled by Girl Scouts in December, features interviews of sitting members of Congress who discuss their thoughts on leadership. These Senators and Representatives vividly demonstrate that some leaders are born women.
It's that time of year again... appraisals, evaluations, bonuses, raises. You know what you want. You know you've worked hard, but this is a tricky topic. Lean in? Wait for Karma? (please don't).

Our country does not confuse freedom with permissiveness, emancipation with indifference. We must care about preserving the rights of our fellow Americans, and not be misled into tacitly supporting the subjugation of some.

If you have a big vision for yourself and what you want to do in the world then it is absolutely vital that you surround yourself with other people like you who have a big vision of what they can achieve in the world.

Sally Ride led a bifurcated life too. She didn't forget part of herself, she just chose not to present it to the world. I am fascinated by her success in transforming the world while hiding part of herself.


It's like once the most wonderful time of the year hits, everyone smiles and gives thanks and acts nice and looks ahead to the new year. Everyone seems to check out of reality and focus on the happiness surrounding them.
For a woman who has been trying to conceive, without success, this type of reflection and comparison can be devastating.  Of course, it is always difficult for women dealing with fertility challenges, but this time of year seems to be the worst.
Imagine a time where you couldn't check Facebook every 19 seconds or Instagram your lobster mac and cheese before you even took a bite. Dark times.
Warning
Sometimes, when I tell people that I am a feminist, they are a little confused about what, exactly, I mean.
The plain truth that they're missing is that physical appearance isn't very important.  To some extent, it reflects a life lived, especially at the extreme ends of the \looks\ continuum.

Some people commenting on the alleged rape at the University of Virginia are angry at \Jackie\ for either making up the story or, if the story is true, not reporting it. Why wouldn't Jackie, or any victim of sexual assault, go to the police? They must be cowards. Shame on them.
Often, people in our 20s are told, implicitly, this period in our lives is just a warm-up for adulthood; that it's about gaining experiences.


They are the hurtful whispers in my head when I'm standing in front of the mirror naked. The thoughts and insecurities when I'm in bed with my husband. These are some of my most painful and embarrassing memories.
The movement for gender equality was originally conceived as a struggle for women's rights by women and only for women. With the HeForShe movement, men are invited and empowered to step up for the women in their lives.
Boa Smith has turned the page. After 29 years behind bars for a deadly crime she says she didn't commit, Boa is in love with life and grateful to finally interact with all of the many pleasures that nature has to offer.
Beyond the window, I see the mind and the heart of someone who chooses to listen to herself, her emotions and watches them pass by -- acknowledged but not burdened by them. Who doesn't use food as a quick, cheap fix for those feelings.

Even if you do everything right leading up to an interview, when it comes to the actual interview, there are things you might do that can sabotage yourself and cause interviewers to form negative opinions,

I was tired of feeling that I wasn't thin enough, pretty enough, smart enough, tall enough or good enough, was keeping me from going after the things I wanted in life. I knew that regardless of what I weighed or looked like -- it was about changing the conversation.
I believe that in any area of our life where we feel stuck, there is fear, and fear causes resistance.  I would encourage you to look into what your desires are, what your fears are and where you are encountering resistance. These are the areas that require your attention.

We all know that there's an invisible switch that gets flipped after you fall head over heels for someone. Suddenly, a lot of the \deal breakers\ or \red flags\ you'd be quick to run away from become \quirks\ and \cute habits\ that you find endearing about your one and only.
We need more than just lip service to women's rights. We need tangible, concrete measures designed to address gender-based violence in the workplace. Ensuring that women have access to jobs with decent pay and safe working conditions is critical to building a just and equal society.
I've got an important anniversary coming up. In January, I will have officially been running my own business for three consecutive years.

While the voice of the \able\ is very welcome in a discussion of disability, those who actually deal with disability and discrimination should not be afraid to speak up and voice their opinions and concerns.
Maybe something as simple as an \I'm thankful for\ jar, can be another way to slow down our lives. To force ourselves to put a pause button on the crazy and pat ourselves on the back for living life as well as we do. It's hard to be a functioning adult and I seriously commend everyone who tries.
I didn't understand why my parents didn't spend money -- and why they never let themselves live a little or take a break from the never-ending quest to save that last dollar. By the time I left for college, I was tired of feeling embarrassed about money, and vowed that I'd finally live the life I thought I deserved as an adult.

Women in my generation have many more opportunities than our mothers did. We can choose to play out a different role, roles that our mothers never dreamed possible.
Many headlines and statistics cited throughout the media regarding female sexuality, I've learned, derive from myths or studies that are outdated, misinterpreted or blown way out of proportion.

Don't let the holes in this story diminish your rage, do not let the fire burning across our schools and nation be smothered by shoddy journalism and a troubled and traumatized girl who has clearly suffered.
I've been working on this piece for over a year and it's gone through many incarnations. Throughout the process, I've learned that silence doesn't make things better, but knowing that silence isn't the answer wasn't enough to get me to speak out. Rather, it was you.
Every step of my career path has been possible because I channeled the confidence that I needed -- from navigating corporate America to starting my own business. That's not to say that confidence was all I needed.
The surest way to avoid ever having your most private photos shared publicly is to not take them in the first place. This is the philosophy behind the most common advice given to teens, among whom the rates of \sexting\ continue to rise. Trust no one. Share nothing. Even better
Nothing changes in our lives until we make a decision to move in a different direction. But how do we move when life paralyzes us by fear, anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed? What do we do to get unstuck? Here are eight reasons why we find ourselves \stuck\ and how to get unstuck.
I'm still relatively new to the world of travel dating so my heart has not yet hardened to the understanding that some things just can't last... no matter how absolutely amazing the connection is and how much you really want to be with the person beyond the vacation.
Research shows how you feel about your vulva matters, and it matters a lot. Here are nine reasons to work on accepting, and ultimately feeling blissful, about all parts of your body.
Boss Ladies of the world -- you are spirit driven. You know who you are. Making the world a better place whether you are working on the proverbial low hanging fruits, or speaking truth to power.

I learned a lot by having L\u00f6fgren syndrome. It taught me how strong and resilient people with disabilities can be, but more importantly, it taught me that people with disabilities don't want my pity -- they want respect and solidarity, just like any other person does.

The first year, I didn't cook Thanksgiving dinner or shop for Christmas presents. I had other children, sure. But I didn't have Emma, and that defined me
I work hard to prove that women have an equal, if not greater place in construction, especially at the management level. While it may remain a primarily male industry for a long time, the role and influence of women of construction will continue to grow and dominate.

The bottom line is that you can't control any aspect of a relationship except what you put into it -- and what you are willing to accept from it. My friend wants to know why things went down the way they did, but she may never find out.
A perfectionist for as far back as I can remember, I can now embrace my imperfections. I realize at last that I wouldn't have half the insight upon which I have come to rely were it not for those trying times in my life.
Being 20 is actually pretty liberating. You're allowed to be unsure about everything. You're allowed to change your mind about what you want in life. Success can come later, but for now, just know that you're not alone.
If food is your largest cause of anxiety, having an entire day focused entirely upon that subject feels like entering a bad dream.
Particularizing \rape on campus\ in the search for real and lasting prevention and solutions will not solve the problem of rape on campus.  The culture that enables rape is the broader one of male dominance, violence and exploitation.
My kids shrink from the annual dinner tradition of reciting three things they're grateful for, but they participate nonetheless. If nothing else, it makes them think for a moment about how they've been aided along the way to enjoy the lives they are now living.
Yes, that overladen Thanksgiving table may look nothing short of sickening to you now. You can't remember when you had an appetite, and you doubt seriously it will suddenly arrive simply because it is Thanksgiving. So, marshal your power and tell your family and friends what you think you need.



I could see the wrongness from a mile away. I had the good sense to push away the first night we met. I got out of the danger zone pretty quickly, but not without first giving him my phone number and getting a bad case of infatuation.
The world has a habit of judging people on their looks. I wish it were different, but it's not. You'll quickly learn that everyone has an opinion on what's pretty and it's virtually unavoidable to not feel the weight of those expectations.
Do we need a few policy changes, sure, but the real issue is the lack of balance between masculine and feminine characteristics in the world. And I don't mean male vs. female. True empowerment comes from peace, which is exactly what the 21st century should be about.
We don't want to talk about the sadness that often comes with motherhood in general, never mind things like miscarriage, infertility or death. We ask women to give birth to stillborn babies and then expect them not to talk about it. We certainly don't want to say the word abortion.
Having choices is supposed to be a good thing, but when you are a woman, one choice in life sucks. The choice that I am referring to is the one regarding embracing either your feminine side or your intellectual side based on the career you enter.



It's time to break the cycle of violence, which is often codified in church doctrines, even here, even now. And part of breaking that cycle of violence, particularly this week, is to accept the challenge to eliminate violence against women from our speech.

I changed the pictures on my profile once a week, allowing enough time for new people to register the change. The information on my profile always remained the same; the only thing that changed was the pictures. I didn't respond to any message during the duration of this experiment.


Feminism has become the word du jour. But what's its message? Its goals? Why is it so divisive?
If my ability to vote and have equal pay and control my body emasculates a man, well the issue is with him, not feminists. I don't see any of these anti-feminists willing to throw away the accomplishments of feminists, and herein lies the irony.
So what if I may be one of the only single girls left in my bicoastal circles? I prefer to shuffle the stack until the right card is dealt, and then make the gamble. I don't want to settle for the next best thing. I want to strive for THE best thing.
Lamilly has potential and certainly is sparking great discourse on a topic that really needs to be addressed in today's society. But we shouldn't rush to congratulate doll makers just yet. Brown locks and a higher BMI aren't enough to make little Lamilly the every-girl doll.


We all care about women's lives, and PEPFAR under President Bush and President Obama has vastly improved the health of women and their families, while building vital healthcare system infrastructure. Let's continue the success, without being undermined by the Global Gag Rule.

I've known smart women who've gone to extremes to hide the fact that they have to work for their figure. I've been one of them. I once got out of sharing bread pudding on a date by saying that the sight of it made me sad because it was served at my grandpa's shiva.
Everyone in every company is -- or should be -- in the business of selling
As women, we must not be afraid to stand alone for a while. We must find who we were before we were someone's wife and mother. We had a life, a name other than honey or mom. It's possible to find love again. It's necessary, to fall in love with yourself first.
You get to move up a couple of rows and you get a less crappy picture. And you see that his suit fits him like a glove. Like a very tight glove. This is important information.
Not only am I still convinced that feminism has a purpose and should be discussed, but I think that initiatives for women's empowerment could hold a lot of promise for ameliorating the issues faced by persons with disabilities in the workplace.

It is simply baffling to me that I was permitted to make a lifelong commitment to someone I love without the certainty that I would be permitted to spend my life with him.


The absolute bedrock of our independence is having control over our own bodies. You cannot be independent if the government or someone else says whether or not you can use birth control.
Prior to being sent to prison, I knew nothing about incarcerated women and, like most of society, I couldn't have cared less. I assumed that all people in prison belonged there, and that they deserved whatever happened to them. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The best time to explore the possibilities is when you can volunteer. Find out what you're passionate about, and give your time and your talent to that.
As the proportion of women in the veteran population continues to grow, all efforts to expand economic opportunities for veterans must include consideration of the additional strengths and challenges of working women.
My boyfriend misses holidays, birthdays and anniversaries. He spends Thanksgiving, most years, on the other side of the world.
If you are going to send a cover letter then you must (try to) find out the name and address the letter accordingly. In a competitive market it is the small things that can separate you from your competition, and correctly addressing your cover letter could be that defining factor.
The mission of the Female Farmer Project is to document the rise of women in agriculture. I share the images and the stories of women who farm. Some of these women are first generation farmers who come from the corporate world; lawyers, anthropologists, executives, scientists who are bringing a unique skill set to the farm. Some are third or fourth generation farmers but bring a new vision and fresh ideas and are responding to the needs of today's economy by diversifying the farm income.
I used to think that my mom made her stand when I was seven in order to teach me to be a gentleman, a concept laden with the trappings of chivalry, often landing at odds with the equality demanded by feminism. Now I realize that she was actually teaching me that it was my job to show respect, keep my head up and look at the world through the lens of others.
I'm done counting points. I will eat the entire brownie. I will say no when I want to say no and try not to feel guilty about it.
We often don't feel entitled to our own biological signals, which is on the list of things that piss me off. Because anger is a tool -- and we're being instructed to neglect it.
Fortunately, you can make the choice to not settle for a mediocre relationship. Don't get me wrong, it's not about selecting self-serving relationships but rather it's about choosing honest, genuine ones with people who value you as much as you do him/her.
Charles Schwab found that 87 percent of American workers would hire someone to change their car's oil, but only 24 percent of people would get help to figure out their 401(k) plans. Avoid the bag-lady scenario
It's tempting to jump into relationships when we meet someone we believe is wonderful. But if it takes a few months to begin gauging someone's character, and two to three years to truly know them, we are setting ourselves up for disaster if we commit too soon.
To cover up my circumstances, I would share and comment on articles on my Facebook and Twitter timelines detailing how domestic abuse needs to be talked about.

This internalized gender hierarchy is so subtle and so pervasive that most of us don't even know how strongly we subscribe to it. And when we open our eyes to it, we prefer to deny it, rather than have the courage to consciously reclaim our whole selves.
Every presentation should be built with the audience in mind. In order to do that, you need to be armed with some important information about them. Here are five key questions so ask of whoever invited you to speak.
The truth is, being able to truly listen can benefit you both in your personal and professional life. It's an essential component of effective leadership and a key trait for being reliable to friends and family. But yet it's still a skill that most of us willingly lack or fail to cultivate -- because it's hard.
've learned a lot about life and humanity from working as a nurse practitioner in pediatric oncology. Some of those lessons have undoubtedly made me a better person than who I was before I learned them. They shifted my perspective. They gave me insight I never would have had.

Cinda needed a bag. A very specific type of bag, mind you.  Machine washable, water resistant, stain resistant, contemporary in design and, most importantly, affordable. It didn't exist. So Cinda decided to create that bag.
Next time you sleep with someone new, think about asking them to discuss their sexual history -- when they were last tested, what STDs they have had or still have, if they always use condoms, etc.
Women have the right to make their own informed choices concerning their sexual health; that gender equality should be the standard when it comes to access to treatments for sexual dysfunction; and that the approval of safe and effective treatments for women's sexual dysfunction should be a priority for action by the FDA.
As a pioneer in the auto industry in 1973, at the ripe age of 19, I was a female salesperson in a male bastion. Not knowing any better, and not caring whether I stuck out or not, I pioneered on to become a female stockbroker in the '80s. Was I what was considered a female libber?

There are infinite varieties of men or at least about 3.5 billion different ones living on Earth now, Klansmen and human rights activists, drag queens and duck hunters. For the purposes of feminism, I'd like to delineate three big blurry categories.
If you really want to love your body, then you've got to first love your life. That means loving yourself enough to pursue that dream you've been keeping on the shelf. Stop being obsessed with your body. Start being obsessed with your life.
Fast Company has published the next installment of its Generation Flux series, in which they outline how \professional missions\ can help shape careers in times of rapid change.
As pundits proclaim that Republicans are poised to possess both houses of Congress this mid-term election I'm both mystified and alarmed. Why would women -- who were the determining factor in the 2012 presidential elections -- give so much power to a party that has such a miserly relationship with us?
I truly believe that one of the single most powerful things that we can do to fight this war against our reproductive rights is to end the stigma surrounding our abortion stories. To stop feeling the need to explain away our choices every single time we mention we have made them.
When we're young, we're all superheroes
You may think I am exaggerating, but saying no has a huge amount of power in it. The flip side of saying no to others is that you get to say yes to someone who is really important.. You.
So go ahead and hashtag your devotion, but learn the cause. Above all, think collectively -- meaning outside your own personal needs. Think about the needs of your sisters around the word and for generations to come.

All across the country right-wing candidates with extreme, outdated views on women's rights are running for seats in the U.S. Senate and calling for the passage of \personhood\ bills and amendments.


On Halloween night, the European Commission -- Europe's \executive\ -- changed. At the helm of foreign policy, Lady PESC -- as Catherine Ashton was known -- gave way to Mrs PESC, as Federica Mogherini prefers to be called. Two different women leaders, two leadership styles in foreign policy.
In 2013, Noel Franus founded P.ink, which stands for \personal ink,\ an organization that helps breast cancer survivors who have undergone mastectomies and breast reconstruction by connecting them with a tattoo artist. The artist works with the survivor to create tattoo designs to cover and hide scar tissue from such operations.
My interview with chief Hello Kitty designer and Japanese pop icon, Yuko Yamaguchi, almost ended before it began. All I asked was
Is Microsoft finally getting serious about making its workforce welcome to women and minorities?
Maybe it's me that's the problem, maybe it's not. Either way, that age-old adage about women flocking to bad boys and nice guys getting left in the dust? Sometimes it has a small amount of truth to it.
A victim of street harassment myself, I often wonder, If you're a construction worker in the throes of the sausagefest that IS your work site, have you offered up as many niceties to your own wife as you did to me just now?
You'll notice I said thinking about sex, not physically having it. It's not that I don't want to, I simply can't muster the energy.
Yes, ladies, this year you can look both SEXY and SMART on All Hallow's Eve! Stand up for women's rights while sportin' more boobage than an underage Reno, Nevada Craigslist escort! This Halloween, look like you're turnin' Tricks while you're actually Treatin' womankind!
The only time I was not in treatment from 2008 until 2011 was when I was pregnant or recovering from a loss. And with all these appointments came countless disappointments.
As children, Halloween was a night of simple joy. It was a damn great holiday. You donned whatever costume you felt like a boss in and without second-guessing it, went out and ended the night with a pillowcase full of candy. You were #FLAWLESS before Beyonc\u00e9 made it a thing.
As I listened to Kathrine Switzer describe her preparation for and her participation in the 1967 Boston Marathon, I knew that I was listening to an amazing history.
I look at this generation and value their confidence and \can-do anything\ attitude. I can't help but wonder what more could be accomplished if we all embraced their ability to look the possibility of failure in the eye and not flinch.
The smiles are the same, and so are the values, the ambitions, the dedication to our families and to our friendships, as are our idiosyncrasies that we still love each other for.
I suddenly had a whole new understanding of my husband. I began to see my husband's childhood in a whole new light. He didn't have to change into pajamas to be comfortable at night. His family did what they thought was the best for him with the knowledge and resources they had.
None of us know our 2.0 and are just trying to figure it out. I change my plan every day. Oprah says everyone of us is looking for the same thing - we want to know we matter! And everyone has a story to tell, I just may not know mine yet.
I'd talk to guys for weeks without either of us initiating any hangout. We were virtual pen pals, wasting one another's time with random texts at odd hours.
U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand recently released Off the Sidelines
The reason our laws have been out of step with what would be best for women is simple
In my process career I have witnessed and/or been part of many process improvement initiatives -- big, small, fully funded and supported, done \off the corner of a desk,\ successful, and unsuccessful.
My desire for Dr. Martens was, of course, a yearning to grow up; or, more accurately, to reach 19 and stay there forever.


There's no way to escape it or avoid it. I don't even have the option of joining a hippie commune like I could if I was tired of capitalism, greed and processed foods.






The International Day of the Girl Child is on a par with the worthy treaties some world leaders sign and then fail to implement. 190 governments have ratified the Convention on the Rights of Children.
As a bi woman, I, along with every bisexual person I've met, have heard the same handful of these ill-informed questions whenever I've chosen to open up about my orientation. Here are 11 things we bi women are just plain tired of hearing.
There is no relaxing when it comes to weight management. Now at my thinnest point in decades, I still feel the weight anxiety almost every day. Who am I kidding? It's every day.

I thanked someone for telling me, in the least-subtle-way-possible, that I had gained weight. And that this weight gain had made me significantly less attractive.
Size does matter, according to the media; however, I love the fact that Meghan is so beautiful and successful and she's not a size two! This is the kind of Girl Power that every girl should see and she wears it so well, but she negates this positive message when she suggests the importance of a girl shaking her body for boys.
In this blog, we'll learn about women who have been inducted into both the Florida Women's Hall of Fame and the National Women's Hall of Fame -- whose accomplishments have benefited women and life in the Sunshine State.
The need to control an undesirable situation by pushing or pulling a partner into compliance is the root of all torment. All we can do is improve ourselves. We can't coerce others or make them want us. But we can show up in a way that allows us to shine, no matter what the outcome.
We don't give relationships enough credit in this world. As a result, people suffer and tolerate mediocre relationships, feeling drained and exhausted as a result, sometimes without even realizing how much better things could be if things were different in the love department.

Do yourself a favor and purge the Prince Charming myth once and for all. Take responsibility for your career goals and go get them now. Sure, you'll get rejected, and you'll get frustrated and be uncomfortable. But it will be yours. Your mistakes, your fear and your victories and triumphs.
My older sister would take me to the library. She never came out and said we were going; it would just happen.
Love
One month before news of this story broke, my wife and I hung up the phone with our cryo-bank, ordered another vial of our donor sperm and are currently waiting for the right time to try again. What if the sperm waiting at our doctor's office for us isn't what we anticipate? Would we be mad? Yes.
I'm pretty sure more than one person has thought that, with our similar hair, skin and eye colors, that we were either brother and really older sister or mom and son, but the pros far outweigh the cons in our relationship.
Everybody has worked for a tough boss. But is being a \tough boss\ different for a woman than a man? Anecdotal, and scientific, research indicates yes. Men are \tough\ bosses; women are \mean\ ones, a fact that is a mix of perception and reality.
Forget identifying that wildflower or monument -- we want to know if this service can help us find out who Smartdude99 is.
The bottom line of this entire scandal is not Lawrence's actions and the religious morals behind them, but the actions of the person or persons who invaded her privacy and allowed the world to see a very personal, private side of her. And she shouldn't take the heat for that.
I know this argument has been made before. That \there's no good porn for women\ is even something of a punchline at this point. But what will it take for someone, somewhere, anywhere, to do something about it?
Breast cancer is not a pink ribbon. Nor is it pink. For Barbie maybe it was more red, white and blue, the color of the flag that will cover her coffin and be given to her son after she is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.



And then the door opened. And standing before us were the two meanest kids in the neighborhood... older kids... nasty kids -- identical twin bullies who once ambushed me when I was riding my bike around the block.
If you're not into going big on Halloween, you'll love easy, transitional pieces. Surprisingly, the best place to look first is your own closet.
Malala Yousafzai is a girl with a voice in a world where women remain voiceless. However, her decision to speak up against the injustices done to her and other young women was not without consequence.
No one knows what to do or say. We try to stay positive in front of my sister and tears find us in the corners of hotel laundry rooms and hospital hallways. Mostly, we just stare off into space until Xanax takes us off to sleep.
Many people have ideas on how to change things or create something brand new. Entrepreneurs act on those ideas. It's all about belief that everything is possible (though it may not be desirable), and that you can make it so.
Take the path of least resistance and flow like water. Your path of Feminine Leadership is like a river. Sometimes calm and serene, sometimes wild and turbulent but always flowing forward towards its destination.
Overall, what message are these companies sending young women? That they *could* have waited? That biotechnology, in its endless wonder, now makes it possible to squeeze out a few more years of loyal work before bringing a tiny new person into this world?

I know, life sucks right now. You're frustrated and no one gets what you're going through. You've been tossed about in the moshpit known as life, and you're tired of smacking into people. It seems like it's going to be this way forever.  But it won't be.

What defines a man as a man these days and how far have millennial men come as far as the variety of emotions they are allowed to express openly?
We cannot simply hope that this will subtly improve or that the next generation of women will have a less shaming experience living in their bodies.
These horrific and terrifying relationships surround us every single day, often forcing us to question the true nature of humanity as we know it.  With divorce rates aggressively rising each decade, perhaps its time we attack this problem at its core.
We incorrectly characterize the only victims of revenge porn as the women whose bodies are offered for public consumption without their consent. The truth is that all women are the targets and victims of revenge porn terrorism. And like all terrorism, the intent is to intimidate one's enemy into a state of fear and submission.

Technology, far beyond email, has enhanced amorous expression
I may not be the most self-confident person on the planet, but I am confident enough to know that I am neither basic nor a b*tch.
I bought my first scale when I was 21, just finishing college and going on my first diet. I bought my second scale, a digital one that was much more precise than the previous model, somewhere in my twenties, so I could know, in even greater detail, how much I was worth.
Nadella missed an immense opportunity to use this platform to become an advocate for women in technology. He should have marked his commitment, on behalf of his company, his industry, and the corporate environment, to helping women achieve personal and professional equality and creating a more diverse, level, and inclusive working world.

When it comes to breasts, there are perky ones, ones that are droopy, lumpy, springy, teensy, full or pointy. The best thing I can say about mine is that they can clear a room.
Yvonne C. Brill received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Obama in October 2011 \for innovation in rocket propulsion systems for geosynchronous.\ Other women have received these medals, also for groundbreaking accomplishments.
There is no shame in earning your own way in what amounts to hard labor. It's actually honorable. Mining strengths I did not know I possessed put my ego back in action.

All to often a woman's time out of the office during her childbearing years is compounded by the time she takes off later to care for her parents and she suffers a significant lost in wages as a result.

I recently crossed over into my 30s. The lead-up to the day was a slurry of thoughts and feelings about this huge milestone, marked by bursts of self-reflection and a quick skip down that list of classic questions about \where I am\ in my life. I thought it prudent to try to gather this slurry into a collection of lessons best learned over the last three decades.
You'll date someone who has \been through some stuff\ and will \need space\ to \get their head together\ before they can \get serious about anyone\ ... Which is basically code for
Are we apologizing in order to navigate our way through a still-sexist workplace, where issuing normal demands and requests can still brand a woman as \difficult\ in the eyes of her coworkers? Are we apologizing to appear more likable? Are we genuinely stepping on a lot of strangers' feet?

Malala's speech is spirited, personable and accessible even as she talks about how she hoped to be a doctor but now, thinking more strategically, she wants to be a politician so she can stay on target and advance the rights of girls.
Do love, treasure, nurture, respect and be kind to your body and who you share it with. The more your love and respect your body, the more men will as well.

In moving to more customized work situations, responsibility and accountability also shifts towards the individual.
I understand that this is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Here is my story.
Here are 10 \favorite\ love stories I've encountered over the years. It's taken me more years to undo some of the damage.
When I was 27, a guy I'd been seeing told me he'd noticed a lump inside me. The word lump has an instant and visceral connection -- you might as well just say \cancer.\ I figured he had far more knowledge of vaginas than I did. Terrified, I went to the doctor. It turned out to be my cervix.
Some days it gets wearying to face the additional challenges it takes for a woman to make it in the world of tech, but on days when it feels like that to me, I pull out the photo of all of the women that attended our first bootcamp.
I just don't quite get what so many feminists and bloggers and all-purpose haters are so up in arms about. So Meghan says she isn't a feminist. Does a person have to be a feminist in order to write and sing about her perspective of body love?
I didn't brush my hair today. I didn't brush my teeth today either. I got dressed in slightly dirty clothing that was conveniently hanging on my bedroom door. I put on makeup, but only because I had to go to work and I didn't want my boss to run an intervention for me.
Sean had never been to Oakland -- that should have been a bright fucking red flag, but alas -- so I told him we should take a long industrial bike ride to a fancy cocktail bar near Emeryville. He arrived. My stomach sank. He was a full-on bro. But he brought me tulips. He was barely breaking even.
When I see that photo of Joan, the newer one, I am filled with hope for her. I am filled with a hope that those battling cancer get to live the rest of their lives, happy and healthy, in honor of those who didn't. In honor of my Dad.
Honoring human rights at home will allow us to promote them abroad; we should be leading by example, enacting sound, evidence-based policies that enable all women to live free of health, social, and economic insecurities.
Casually, I think most Americans would agree that there should be equal representation behind the lens. And I don't suspect a high-level Hollywood conspiracy. No racist or sexist villains lurking in the halls of power, twirling their mustaches. Honestly, I think dudes are comfortable with other dudes, so they hire them.
Unless the men at the top of our organizations strategically decide that equality at the top is the right thing to do, it won't happen.
I got to a really good place in my career. And then, reality set in. I plateaued, I had no personal life and I was exhausted by the late hours and the daily grind of navigating corporate culture.
Like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Spencer Tracy and Kathryn Hepburn, Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal, Doritos and I have a passionate AND complicated relationship.
I've never really been a writer and at this stage I still wouldn't say that I am a writer, but since starting my personal blog, I've really enjoyed writing and sharing my experiences and journey from my eyes and in my words.
It is true that there are fewer women getting funded and building billion-dollar companies. The numbers are improving, yet we still have a long way to go. The answer to this problem is to start early and to focus on the internal factors causing this imbalance.
While our beloved celebrities may win awards for their on-screen personas, the public is usually pretty conscientious of who actually has a heart invested in their said foundations and organizations and who has a publicist shoving an agenda down their throat.
Many historical women whose accomplishments we are aware of today had to battle society's perceptions of women's proper place. Some women were fortunate enough to have the support of a man in their endeavors -- the \He for She\ paradigm Emma Watson recently spoke of at the U.N.

Online dating seemed ideal, and was surely going to be the gateway to widen my dating horizons. No awkward pick-up lines, or reading between the lines. In this digital dating landscape, I was able to put my best self first. But online dating has made me feel more alone and rejected than ever.
While many of my friends spend hours trying to dissect what that lack of an exclamation point in a text really means, I'm free to frolic about and do whatever the hell I please.

I have to admit recently I have been struggling with my life and what I am planning to do. I have gotten to an age where I have done one thing for a long time.  I am grateful for the places it has taken me and the opportunity to be creative.  It's been a great way to make a very nice living.
If we want a freer, safer, and fairer world for women and girls, our organizing must not only be about celebrity endorsements, convening conversations among experts, or casual activism on social media. The voices of actual women living in poverty and violence must be heard.
I like the term \shameless self promotion,\ because it flies in the face of the standard teaching that self promotion, especially for people who do spiritual or healing work is a no-no. Humility and letting people come to you and then not expecting to get paid much if at all, is to considered a virtue among some circles.
Getting dumped can suck, but most guys are used to it. We've either gotten the heave-ho ourselves or known guys who have. And though we tend to jump right back into the dating pool, the pain can linger. That's why it's only right that when it's our turn to sever ties, we do it thoughtfully, taking the high road whenever possible.

Just because you deal with depression doesn't mean that you are depression. A bad day/week doesn't mean a bad life. After all, it's not sunny every day but we know the clouds won't last forever.
I spent most of my 20s obsessing about love. When will I meet him? When will I find true love? Why isn't he calling me? Why am I alone? Where is he? Who is he? Am I over him? Why can't I get over him? These were the litany of questions that lived in my mind every day.
That summer taught me that you can have your heart broken and still be OK; that moments of foolishness make you wise; that part of dating is learning what you don't want; and that you have to love yourself before anyone worthwhile ever will.


If the percentage of qualified women remains lower than that of men, gender balance at all organizations is mathematically impossible. The cure then is to fix the pipeline. The gender balance in pay will follow.
How's your to-do list looking today? Lot's of really important stuff that you must get done to keep things moving on the work and home front? I get it. But what I would also like you think about is what can come off the list




It's time to change the conversation about gender equality. While at first blush, men seem to benefit from many privileges at work, the truth is, they pay a heavy price. As we barrage women with questions about whether or not they \have it all,\ we silently assert that men do. And they don't.
The truth is, no matter how thick the skin, words are able to penetrate and do their dirty work. It is when we believe them, that they are the most insidious.
In my first marriage, which lasted 18 years, I had a hard time being seen naked. Especially in my child-bearing years, when my only purpose was to serve my children, to be their sustenance. My sexuality went right out the window.
Tami Simon, Founder and CEO of Sounds True, shares her daily experience with fear and her advice on how fear can strengthen the emerging process in this excerpt from our Grace&Fire podcast.
My files were being judged. Women were looking at them and deciding whether or not they wanted my eggs to make a baby with. It was a little surreal.
Taking accountability for yourself and your work means accepting the good along with the bad. If you own up to your mistakes, why shouldn't you own up to your victories? Here's how to start getting over the fear of healthy self-promotion.

Little kids are honestly the best when it comes to making and keeping friends. Their sense of wonder and overall joie de vivre makes them the perfect magnets for new relationships, while their untainted understanding of logic allow them to make quick and simple decisions about their interactions with others. Given their talent in this area, we adults are wise to take a few tips from our kids.

Women tend to recognize the investment their employer made in them and they want to repay it. In Jody's case, she didn't realize that she had long ago repaid her boss just by doing a stellar job during the previous 10 years.
I tell anyone who asks that being an entrepreneur is tougher than running Merrill Lynch. That's not to say it's not an unbelievable experience... but it's not for everyone. Here's how to make the switch.
I was surprised by the hype. I hadn't considered any one of Watson's scripted statements to be new, let alone groundbreaking. They were simply a helpful reminder of what battles still need to be fought upon the field of modern feminism. Or was I missing something?
I was positive people wouldn't accept me if they knew I pulled out my hair. And I was even more positive that if they did find out, if they didn't judge me for pulling, they'd reject me for the fact that I didn't know why I was doing it, and that I wasn't able to stop myself.
Seriously, we are on the same team. Love and be loved by other women, because when we work together we are a force to be reckoned with.


I cut my hair really short last week and all those ideas I used to have about if I was really feminine enough came back with a vengeance. And now I'm noticing that I'm overcompensating for my short hair with dressier clothes and more eye makeup. Just in case someone might think I'm a boy.

We need a nationwide conversation with young women. There's a difference between a bad relationship and an abusive one, and there's a difference between persistence and stalking.




My mother was a terrible cook, but she set a beautiful table. Every year at least a week before the Jewish holidays -- which, as she used to say, fell either too early or too late, but were never on time -- she'd get out her most favorite dishes.
I won't tell you to hang in there. I don't expect you to cheer up just because people keep saying encouraging things to you. I actually will say the opposite
The NFL created a VP of social responsibility position and put a woman in it. And look, look, we appointed some other women, too! Great. Band-Aids are helpful first aid tools, too, but not for broken bones.
Enjoying sporting events is fun, but, like Wall Street, the subsidies and salaries have gone too far. These privileges are at the expense of taxpayers and society as a whole as the Rice fiasco illustrates.

Being employed and balancing a family can be one of the most difficult challenges of working mothers but it won't just happen, you need to step off this terrifying treadmill. Trust that it can also be the most satisfying experience.
They don't call when they say they will. They don't show up when expected. They brood at social gatherings with friends and family. You're fairly certain they're cheating on you in office cubicles, toilet stalls and perhaps even in your own bed.
The relationship was a total roller coaster, and it definitely had it's thrills, but the thrills came at a cost. Every time we'd go out I felt pressured to drink more than I was comfortable with. I did it in part to impress them and also to ease the anxiety I was feeling.
You said, \it's important to make beneficial lifestyle changes to promote healthy weight, just as it is important to have healthy self-esteem.\ You are trying to tell people that you can only feel good about yourself if you are not fat.
If they're flabbergasted, you haven't given them enough feedback on their performance. Which means you likely aren't giving your team enough feedback. Which means your team is likely performing sub-optimally.
We wish Ray Rice had never assaulted Janay. We wish all the factors that led to his decision to be abusive and violent did not exist. We wish that all the people in Ray's life who had concerns about his behavior had done more to support him by challenging that behavior.
You need to invest in yourself financially, physically, mentally and emotionally. This isn't just about a 401K.
There a lot of people, mostly women, many of whom are feminists, willing to opine on the ills of the Miss America Pageant without knowing a thing about the girls who enter them, let alone the money you can make. This is nothing new.
The world needs to embrace a global conversation about how women have been disempowered in most of the areas central to meaningful human experience. It needs a global conversation about how the empowerment of women is the central social challenge facing humanity today.

Women are not anti-men for we need both genders to balance our world in a more productive and responsible way .We are also not the weaker sex... or let's say gender... we just have a more balanced way of thought
Disagreeing with someone's argument is done through facts and analysis, which is completely necessary for healthy debate. Disagreeing by calling for violence is an attempt to silence a voice you think doesn't have a right to speak. There is a clear difference.

Bond's written 22 books since she retired decades ago. Bond uses only two criteria when allowing real patients onto her imaginary couch
You don't have to birth 19 kids, be a Christian, wear a purity ring, have long-ass hair, or agree with any of the politics of the Duggar family to apply their rules about dating and courtship to your own life.
Something very exciting is happening at the number one women's glossy. For the first time Cosmopolitan is endorsing political candidates. Basically, the editors now have your back on what colors are in this fall and what names you should be checking in the voting booths next month.



It was while watching Melissa Rivers co-host a red carpet event with her mother, Joan Rivers, that I first recognized the look on Melissa's face as her mother spoke.
By taking these over sexualized, yoga posing selfies, and posting them for the world to see, these women make it almost impossible for women like me (whose hands don't even come close to touching the floor when we bend over) to feel good about going back to our yoga practice.
The way most of us talk about sex is rather messed up if you take a step back and let it all marinate in your mind for a minute. We speak about sex like it's some consumptive act -- like we're getting frozen yogurt or something.
A woman who is fulfilled loves herself. She makes sure she fills her cup first because she is aware to give and receive in this world she has to be full and come from a place of knowing her worth. She is both practical and spiritual.


My friends would at times call me a robot, laid back, cold. I took pleasure out of this -- to me it was proof that I had succeeded.
Braveness means accepting rejection but treating failure as an essential part of success. True bravery is the realization that other women are not your competitors and that we can all assist one another. It's also about wholeness.

By commenting on a woman's body, you are continuing a cycle of perceiving our bodies for how they appear rather than for what they can do.

If you are a guy who has to assault a woman's dignity and privacy in order to fulfill your sexual fantasies, that says far more about you than it does about her.
I was confused. I had no idea what to do. It seemed insatiable and dangerous. There was no place for this in the life I'd built.
What does a discussion among women engineers sound like in U.S. Southeast? The South is not a region identified as a hub of STEM careers for women, but the massive influx of international manufacturers and their vendors has rapidly changed the landscape.
We've become a society that feels entitled to the nudity of others; consent is not required, just as long as we get our fill of flesh.



If you're young, black and female, your identity might be a liability. Recent studies have proven that online dating can be tainted by racism.



I don't blame the young man for taking the visual cue of my body and neatly categorizing me with the 5k'ers (which is also a very respectable distance, by the way). Why would he believe that my plus-size body is capable of 21 long kilometres when there aren't any visual cues presented in society to tell us this is possible?

Volatility and overwhelming emotions like sadness are flooding into everyone's consciousness, but that's our key to freedom right there
Victim-blaming, sl*t-shaming, skepticism, deflection and insults, this perpetual \Not my problem!\ mentality... it's all of a piece and it's all part of why some men harass, sexually assault, beat, rape, and kill women.



If you're considering loaning money to friends or family, make sure you fully understand your expectations throughout the entire process, and make a plan together for how the money is to be used -- before you give.
Why is it that a woman has such a hard time feeling good in her skin when her skin is stripped bare of potions and lotions and creams, when there is not filter or Photoshop?
How do you foster real friendships and dump the duds? Believe it or not, female friendships fall into categories. Here are types of women you want in your life:
Today I am sharing what I believe are success clues gleamed by extraordinary women who have reached the pinnacle of success in their fields. Many of these women have key habits and practices in common that played a big part in their career.
Whether the next few weeks into September mean prepping your kids for the new school year, starting a new job or gearing up for a big work or household project, there are many changes that occur that can be nerve-wracking.
Because fat girls aren't supposed to take pleasure in our bodies or even consider showing other people what they look like, there is a lot of sh*t that can hit the fan. Mostly caused by other people not knowing how to handle someone as sexy as me owning it.

The scene among the business women entrepreneurs and executives in business I have met and know has changed from what it once was just a few years ago. The dreams and goals we had and hoped for now pay the bills.






I came of age at a time when women's appeal for equal opportunity on the career ladder was coupled with a decree that we could, in fact, do it all and have it all. We believed that \work-life balance\ was an achievable, worthy pursuit.
I watched as these girls, even in class, were pre-occupied with their looks, pushing their boobs up, rolling their shorts up and trying to get away with whatever they could to make themselves more sexually appealing. Where did I, as a brown hijabi girl fit in?



Catcalling isn't about flattery, the men aren't doing it to make you feel beautiful or special. They're doing it because of a sense of entitlement. Because to them, every woman is fair game regardless of what time of day it is or where you are or what the woman is doing.


As I learned in the trenches, the only thing keeping each of us back from satisfaction is our unwillingness to say yes to adventure that scares us and shakes our comfortable status quo.


It's worth a thousand words for sure. You can tell a lot just by looking at it. But not everything.  Here's 10 things this picture won't tell you.
We need more celebrating of each other's goodness and more having each other's backs. And sometimes that means going out of the way to help each other take that step or leap that seems both terrifying and wickedly exciting.


Fear has no place in a healthy, interpersonal relationship. If you're fearful in your relationship, ask yourself why.
You would be surprised how painful sexual rejection is for men. Often, I see couples in which the man still remembers and is hurt by a sexual rejection occurring even years ago, at the start of the relationship.

At the age of 24 I began to ask my doctors if I could be sterilized. Year after year at my annual exam I would state my case -- each year unchanged from the previous year. At each visit my physician told me that I was too young, what if I changed my mind? But the reality was that I didn't change my mind.
Body love has nothing to do with our bodies, but the stories they tell. It's about taking ownership of our stories so that we can be resilient in the moments when the visions and hopes we have for ourselves are challenged by what other people think.
No one had ever told me that my thighs were huge. It wasn't like they were out of proportion with the rest of my body or I had to search the mall for pants wider in the thigh. Was it a compliment? I wasn't sure.
Did school teach you the skill for the job and the career center teach you how to get the first job? Yup, but most likely no one taught you about all the things that can happen in the first job. Here are five tips to help negotiate the early part of your career and beyond.
Ultimately, it's time to redefine the word \feminist\ and what it actually means. Because the truth is, we all need feminism. Only once being a feminist becomes the norm and not the exception,  will we finally be able to make true, structural progress toward gender equality.
Female hormones are quite delicate and susceptible to imbalance, which can leave us feeling somewhat crummy (to put it nicely). Here are five signs your hormones might need some loving.
My tears are not because his time on Earth is over. My tears are for his friends, his wife and his children. They are the ones left behind.  The \Genie\ may be free, but his family is left here to wade through the pain, confusion and fog that is... suicide.
The Single Inferiority Complex describes the often-nagging feeling that single (and sometimes childless) people have that their lives, and even their very selves, just do not measure up to those who are in partnership (or who are parents).

Yes, I actually said that to someone, out loud, in public, without shame. My husband and I were standing by the meat case in Scott's, chatting with his boss's wife about chicken breasts.
Consider wearing a sturdy pair of well-worn Birkenstocks the first four dates. This also weeds out the Modelizers (men who only date models -- thankfully George Clooney has graduated from their ranks).
Most of us are raised on fairytales and Hollywood (mostly the same thing). For years we believe that our perfect someone is out there, our singular soul mate -- and we wait for him (or her).

For me, once I admitted that I really like sugar, and that eating it makes me happy, my cravings died down. I stopped wanting it because I knew I could eat it if I wanted it. I replaced my years of resistance and pushing away the foods I loved with a more compassionate approach.
I've ended up with three little boys; I know they're still young, and I have my work cut out for me, but I know I'm up to the task. I know now that my destiny was never to \fix\ men; it was to raise them. And I know my daughters-in-law will someday thank me for raising Mama's Boys.
I've never inquired because, frankly, I never thought anyone would care much about the answer. I was wrong -- and the thousands of people who shared the article on Facebook in the first 24 hours after publication make that clear. Yes, it's a great question, but perhaps I have an even more important one
She is just one cat picture short of having whiskers tattooed on her face. You know the woman sits on her couch day and night, stroking cats and talking to herself.

Most researchers believe there are three primary motivating factors behind dating someone at work -- love, ego and job. Men do it for love. Women do it to get ahead. That's the outrageously biased way people judge office romances -- and another example of women getting a bum deal.
By their very nature, women are nurturers and tend to give out more than they receive. Soul time is important for women to stay connected within. If women can make soul time a part of their daily life they will have happier lives and be more fulfilled in their relationships.
Millennial-focused media is just beginning to recognize this emerging mindset and celebrities are popularizing and glamorizing this path, too, with powerful women like Chelsea Handler, Zooey Deschanel and Cameron Diaz leading the charge.
Perfection is like a carrot on the end of a stick mounted to your head. You keep thinking you can grab it if you run hard enough, and sometimes you can get a little taste of it, but it's never quite enough.
While there are a lot of things about life with my kids that make our reality as a family different than it would have been BC (that's, \before cancer\ in our house), those things in the end are just our normal.
We could use some new stories about ourselves and our lives. What do you think? These posts were good the first time we saw them, but can we have some new topics? Let's not write these.
I moved to Oakland two years ago on the cusp of my 28th birthday. Like so many spindly-rooted transplants before me, I was ready to leave NYC -- Brooklyn to be exact -- but knew New York was a hard act to follow.
When you feel like all that's being accomplished is one person trying to yell louder than the other, walk away -- hang up the phone -- and sign off Gchat for a few minutes.
The healthcare provider assured me that there was no need to make an appointment -- here at Mulu, patients came in and got family planning counseling services on a \walk in\ basis.   In addition, all family planning services and contraceptives were free. With the incentives mounting high and a full range of choices available, I could find no better place to start planning for my family.
When it comes to earning power, the number of Americans who advocate non-traditional marriages is steadily increasing.

Why do we, as a society, instead of celebrating the wonders of the female reproductive system, ridicule it and teach our girls to hate the monthly arrival of Aunt Flo?
In retrospect, being curled up in fetal position makes perfect sense. When you find yourself in that protective posture, it may very well be that you are about to experience a rebirth. It's just an incubation period before your emergence.

The biggest benefits of online dating are the ability to deliberately craft a great first impression (that can't be messed up by nerves) and to stretch yourself to date differently than you have in the past.
If you constantly feel like you're not good enough or that you don't deserve whatever great things have come your way in life, try changing the way you respond to the compliments you undoubtedly receive.
Maybe some people could remove themselves from that situation, flip an on-off switch. I am not one of those people. When I let people in, I inevitably begin to care. It is both a blessing and a burden.
We all have times that we feel alone or fear that somehow we'll be forgotten simply because we've changed in a way that others find hard to accept.
In a world that thrives on instantaneous interaction with a vast amount of people, attitudes towards conversation have become increasingly casual. The etiquette of communication has changed.
I don't just want a relationship where I need someone to make me feel whole. That needs to come from within me not from someone else. I think two incomplete people don't make two whole people; they make two unhappy people in one miserable relationship.

For three days, I didn't brush my hair, I didn't wear makeup and I wore the same pants. Pee splattered on my ankles, and my nails were full of dirt. I gave up on my appearance. Instead, I looked at lakes, mountains and wildflowers. The result? My inner beauty felt alive and healthy.
From well-paid business executives to low-paid retail workers, everyone I talked with is weighed down by something similar -- the anxiety generated by hard times. Across the class spectrum, we all feel insecure. We just feel it and deal with it in different ways.
Every time we give another woman permission to talk about her experience openly, we reclaim a little power from a society that tells us we should just grin and juice cleanse it.


If one of the fastest growing sports in America can apply the concept of equal pay for equal effort, we should be able to do the same in the world of work.

I once cared deeply about these things. But as I've gotten older and \wiser\ (debatable), I've realized they just don't matter to me.

I don't want her blue eyes the way her husband must want them before they closed each night. I don't want her body, and not just because it's gone. It was never mine to covet in the first place, just like her life.
love this story. So often we have an awkward encounter with the opposite sex and it becomes nothing but fodder for a larger argument about why \men are pigs\ or \women are impossible.\


Be your own best friend. I know it sounds incredibly corny, and yet it really is true. Because in reality, the only person you are absolutely guaranteed to go through life with and the only person that you truly know you can always count on, is yourself... so treat yourself with the care.
The comic book world is chock full of crime-fighting male superheroes. So it should come as no surprise that women (and men) enthusiastically greeted the recent announcement that Wonder Woman would play a key role in the upcoming Batman vs. Superman film.
\If your 'friend' expresses interest in another friend of yours, you wouldn't hesitate to introduce them,\ explains Coleman. \But if you feel saddened or threatened by their interest in your other friend, then you're simply NOT 'just friends.'

I understand that there are women who are indeed coerced into sex work, who are abused by pimps, mistreated by johns, raped and bullied by men on the streets. But that simply was not my story. I made a conscious decision to enter the sex industry. When I wanted to quit, I did. So yes, for me, a job in the sex industry certainly made more sense than a job at Walmart.
Playing the diplomat isn't always possible, especially if a frenemy clearly crosses a workplace line. Feelings of tension can also hinder productivity for both parties, so it can be helpful to clear the air.
When you enter the world with two X chromosomes, you get placed quickly into a box. The Girl Box. Here, acceptable hair and clothing preferences are assumed; color and toy preferences are dictated.
The key, I believe, to surprise successes is constantly showing up and consistently taking action. Life doesn't \just happen,\ though at times it can feel that way. We've got to go and get it.
Very few men are going to know what you want, when you want it and how you want it. My grandmother used to say, \You must summer and winter, and summer and winter, with a man to truly know him,\ and for him to truly know you. Give a man the chance to know you.
You see, I have two distinct sides to me
Assess each new partner as an individual, and stay keenly connected with how you experience yourself while in his or her presence.
My body tells the story of all the pieces of women who made me; an amalgamation of my ancestry. I am a patchwork quilt of evolution built from the genetics of women who lived remarkably unremarkable lives.

Charming and funny, he was also entirely unassuming. He got good grades, had lots of friends. He was a talented artist and student. He was also a dude who raped me. The fact that he's sweet and loves his mom doesn't change the fact that he had sex with me against my will.

To anyone who wants to be in many places at once, write. To everyone who doesn't think they're a \good writer,\ write. To those wanting to connect to their soul and inner wisdom, write.
When it comes to the intricacies of fashion, we women dress for each other. Of course we want the boys to like (lust, adore, pine for) us, but there are very few men out there who know something fabulous when they see it. And when they do, we start feeling a little suspicious.
Would you like to know why I choose an IUD as birth control? Because my husband and I enjoy having sex and we cannot afford another baby. Because I have been on hormonal birth control to manage severe cramps. Because I had a D&C five days postpartum after delivering our first son.
An hour? To choose a wedding dress for the biggest day of your life? Unheard of. After all, one's wedding dress symbolizes a milestone, having great potential in becoming a family heirloom.
If after considering all these things, you still feel that genders are either already equal or they don't need to be, I suppose you're entitled to your opinion.

Kissing seems like it would be one of those instinctive things humans do like yawning, stretching or scratching. After all, what is the big deal about two pairs of lips locking together? However, some kisses can be relationship-ending turnoffs.

It's not always easy, especially as women, to foster sincere friendships. The ego loves to sink its teeth into thoughts provoking jealousy, competitiveness and insecurity. Women often love to hate other women.
But there is some link, at least for me, between a happy home life and being a slug about everything else. That Josh loves me can't be the reason I love myself. That he thinks I am smart, competent and worthy can't be the reason I believe those things. It has to come from me.
My generation has a seat at the table, but it comes with strings attached. I'm hoping that the next generation does not have to have \rules\ for working in a man's world.
A remarkable thing happens when I take a break to be still -- the demands that seemed so unwieldy become manageable.
I absolutely adore children. Or rather, I adore them as long as I can escape from them at the end of the day. And I think that is perfectly OK.
I met a man 16 years ago. 14 years ago, he made me his wife. Like everyone, our marriage has had struggles. Now, after all the battles in which we have triumphed, we are facing our greatest one yet.

Call yourself anti-feminist all you want ladies, but never forget that you have the freedom to define yourself because of feminism
I didn't realize that you can't escape from cooking if you have a family. And despite my lack of talent in the kitchen, I still managed to become a codependent housewife.

May I introduce to you

The Bumbling Husband is that lovable but incompetent man who just can't seem to keep himself out of trouble, much less keep a house in order. He is Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin.
Inspiring people is great! It implies that you have moved them mentally or emotionally in some way. But motivating people implies action. Go ahead and inspire all you want. But leave the action to other people! If you don't, you will only become as frustrated and exhausted as I've been.
The media makes it out to be a myth. A goal for every summer. No one truly has the bikini body that fitness/health publications talk about because it is not real. It is fictional. Yet, they give you just a few easy steps to get the body \they\ want... not the one you want.

There are sound reasons why you rarely hear about female rape offenders




Stop focusing on what you don't have and start developing what you do have. Your sacrifice is only meaningful if you use it as a springboard to positive actions that keep you on track. The more love you give, the more you'll receive.
I turned 34 this year. Yes, 34. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm in my mid-thirties and am no longer the young woman I used to be, and I'm OK with it.
Without you, we'd have been cooked, which would have been almost as bad as driving over the edge of the Grand Canyon. On behalf of myself, my friend, her dog, and all foolish drivers, I belatedly thank you.
Like many women, I've often distilled body image into a series of cold hard numbers
If they aren't the person you used to know and love (and you can't get on board with who they are now) then let them go.

It's a form of torture for which we actually pay good money and we submit to it, if not happily, at least willingly. And we do this so that what nature gave us can be tweaked into a new version of what's acceptable.
I believe it is parents' responsibility to launch their children after college, letting them both succeed and fail on their own.
Take these to heart if you want to start repairing the damage that's been done and work on creating a happier future together.
We should consider the people who know how to love deeply or are positive influences or even people who are warriors of peace more beautiful than the stick skinny starved models we see on the runways.
Why is youth better than age and wisdom? It's not. We only think it is because we all \drank the Kool Aid.\
This clich\u00e9, \Your purpose is in your pain,\ surrounds the theory that in sharing your most hurtful, embarrassing, debilitating experiences will somehow bring you into your purpose, and that it is synonymous with experiencing success.
It's right out of a Sandra Bullock movie. Two completely opposite people meet and, in spite of their polar opposite personalities, they fall in love. Opposites attract! Well... sort of.
You round a corner and you are here. And you begin to cry a little when you realize that it will not be fancy and there will be no amuse bouche and most certainly no Michelin star chef and that you are supremely overdressed. And it could not be more perfect.

Forgetting can be a beautiful thing, but sometimes we live too much in the present. We forget about all the girls and women we have been.


I was probably too young to realize it at the time, but that bear taught me everything I needed to know about feminism.
In order to achieve true equality in the work force, the CEO suite and the board room, more women must be willing to balance their personal choices with their duty. All women deserve these opportunities and our grandchildren need us to keep the movement going.
Smart women entrepreneurs usually achieve high-level success leaving a wake of failures that cannot be rebounded from, only lived. Women are, and always have been, trail-blazers in the business world.


I was awarded more scholarship money than the cost of attendance, and as a result, received refund checks back each semester, totaling over $10,000 in the last two years of my college career.


We need to reframe the conversation for women (and men) around success, but not focus on an antiquated notion of work-life balance or having to achieve a certain \level\ of success, but by the fundamental way we live our lives and what we want to be remembered by.
When someone you love commits suicide, people around you are quick to say, \It wasn't your fault.\ But I don't know.

I know how it feels when the people in your life do crazy with unparalleled proficiency and panache. Sometimes it seems your only option is to unleash a well-deserved mix of rage, inarguable criticisms and the list of how you do the whole living thing in a superior fashion.

Little House on the Prairie taught me about living on a farm in the 1800's. It also taught this big-haired '80s girl that good hair has always been important, even for Pa back in Walnut Grove.
The male position is not the neutral position. It has a point of view, the male point of view, which not everyone shares, and which is not always superior.  So please, stop announcing that Landon Donovan is the \all-time U.S. leading goal scorer.\

Presumably I, as a fat woman, would not know how to properly operate the complicated piece of equipment known as a bikini. What if I became distracted by the complexity of spandex, a substance heretofore unknown to me, and wandered blindly into traffic? What if I ate it?

There's a great myth that's been hoisted upon all women that \dating\ is fun. I'm convinced it's a conspiracy crafted to guarantee an ongoing form of economic revenue; women are forced to buy new clothes and makeup while men are lured into exorbitant restaurants to prove their merit.
Every month, I refill my prescription for birth control pills and every day at the same time (well, mostly the same time), I swallow one of the little pills with a sip of water. But the reason I started taking birth control pills and continue to take them is probably not what you're thinking.
In my 30+ years of clinical experience, I've seen that abusers are often unable to solve conflicts verbally. Under stress, words fail them. Instead of using the small muscles around their mouth to discuss a problem, they lash out with large arm or leg muscles to relieve the tension.
We sat on the edge of Berehaven harbor, a fishing port on the southwestern coast of Ireland. Looking out into the misty water as a light drizzle began to fall onto empty boats, I wanted Charlie to kiss me even though I had a boyfriend back home.


In September, my father-in-law is making my dream of being in the same room with Oprah come true. But more importantly, he has taught me the power of sharing my purpose with the world.
I am (a fake) blonde and have large breasts. I am also a writer, employed and pursuing my Master's. These are things that make me \me.\ These are all things that have nothing to do with each other. Right?
I believe relationships should be built on trust, honesty and respect for each other's personal space. What I'm going to give you is a blueprint for building a trusting, loving relationship.
Don't apologize for your wrinkles, your opinion, your thighs, your voice, your cellulite, or your past. Just shut up about, you sexy thang, and celebrate by living.

What is dating for, if not to teach us what we don't want? Each special person to cross our paths leaves a mark, a lesson -- sometimes in the form of scars, other times as fond memories. Yet in the end they play the same role -- they teach.
Food has been my best friend, my boyfriend and my enemy since... like... birth. I started drinking milkshakes from the soda fountain at Woolworth's at 3-months-old and it's been a battle ever since.
However narratively clumsy, adaptations like Maleficent are inherently constructive. They teach us to humanize others in a society stalled not by men themselves, but by a patriarchal legacy that's dismissed qualities of the ancient goddess.


When it comes to appearance, our bodies are considered guilty until proven innocent. The areas for judgement, from space between thighs to brow ridge prominence, are so numerous that it feels safer to just settle on one and own it.

Desire will give us a short-lived thrill. It doesn't last. Having money to go on a shopping spree will only give us that adrenaline rush until the money is spent.



The most dates I've ever had in a week was five -- all with different guys. It's rare, but I've even had multiple dates on the same day. Coffee? Lunch? Dinner? Drinks? There are too many options. Once, I brought two guys out on a  group date. It really was an accident.
Ever fixate on someone else's success to the point that you think they shine the \brightest,\ just like the North Star? (But guess what? The North Star isn't the brightest star in the sky, not even close!) Their \star\ doesn't shine any brighter than yours!
4. Do you want to meet my boyfriend's dog sitter's cousin? He's recently single and though he's not really my type, I think you might like him. No, thanks.
Should girls go out of state in order to be closer to their boyfriend's new occupation? Should they plan their life around someone who isn't their husband? Should they demand a ring before they make any big choices? And if they do so... are they now...\that girl\?
Empowerment comes from within. Whether it's business or personal, once you consciously choose to not listen to your intuition, you have disempowered yourself.
We all venture into the dating world hoping that others will appreciate our charms, even if our noses are crooked or our bellies spill over our belts. And the good news is they will -- but it may take some time.
Weakness and vulnerability are not the same. In case you'd forgotten. It is sometimes helpful to remember this.
I realized that I have been judged my whole life, and what I did was wrong. She had nothing to do with people calling me fat, stupid and lazy. I did by not standing up for myself.

Through being vulnerable we can show others our wounds, we can show them that we all have the same ones. I want you to see that there is always hope, that there is always light around us and that we are ultimately much more resilient than we could ever imagined.
It seems Barbie's mid-life crisis started around five years ago when this former beauty queen was traumatized after receiving her AARP card in the mail.  Recent tattoos, endless diets, strict workout regimens, and bizarre anti-aging rituals- yep, her mid-life crisis was in full swing.  Who can blame her?
Can you name your top five strengths -- you know those things you're good at and actually enjoy doing at work? If you struggled, you're not alone.
Remember to not let work or yourself get in the way when there is a time when a loved one really needs you. Women tend to think they can do it all, but that is not always the case in every situation in your life. It is OK to put work on the back burner during difficult seasons in your life.
I understand now more than ever that women, regardless of their religion, culture, or social status, have very similar challenges and needs. Because of this understanding I am better able to embrace myself as a woman. Furthermore, I am better able to be supportive of other women.
There seems to be a tendency for women to hold beliefs and attitudes about their own gender that are similar to the beliefs and attitudes that men have about women. In other words, women seem to be stereotyping other women like men.
You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find the one you love, and the same thing is true in business. You know it when you find it, and if you're not sure, keep looking.
One breezy September evening, I gave my mom the verbal OK, my username, my password and my attention. I let my mom take over my JDate account for one night.
I learned that detachment isn't about giving up, It's about giving over. Giving it over to God, the universe, whatever you believe in.
What is our fascination with realty television? Why can't we watch documentaries or shows that teach us something like America with Lisa Ling, instead of finding satisfaction in seeing other people's dysfunctional lives?
You must constantly remind yourself that


Creating a culture of consent for both genders means acknowledging that \no\ means all kinds of things. But, if you're hearing it from someone who identifies as female, it should never be taken as \Yes, I'm a prude, and my goal here is to ruin your fun.\
Make a commitment and strive to understand your friends, coworkers, daughters and moms -- because they are being judged just as harshly for their intrinsic personalities. Let's work to be embraced by our choices, instead defined by our of limitations.
The messages of body image and appearance are exhausting. But, real value does not rise or fall with the number on a scale. Real worth does not count wrinkles or number of years.
Some dramafied episode will happen. It just will. I've seen fistfights that ended the dancing part and major b*tchery between the bride's newer friends and older ones. I've seen food throwing between divorced parents of the bride.
We spend so much of our free time (or our on-the-clock time) browsing through our social media pages and posting some of the most personal photos and facts about what we are up to or what we desperately strive to become. Quite often I feel as though I'm learning more about people on Twitter or Instagram than I would if we were sitting across one another.
A little over a year ago, at 20 years old, I took my last sip of alcohol. That's right -- I've never even had a legal drink. Instead I've had lessons -- some of them obvious, others blessings in disguise.
I want to fill you in on a little secret that you may have forgotten between pomegranate and plyometrics

It was an auspicious start for women in technology, but unfortunately, more than 170 years later, women remain woefully under-represented in technology and little funding is steered toward them.

Like most men in the days prior to the high-tech era, dad loved gadgets. He had an electric shoe shine machine, a weather radio, a movie camera and projector, a tape recorder and a slide projector. I wanted to get him something to add to his collection.
If you are still involved with a narcissist, you may not realize how completely your attention has been diverted from your self and your own life.
We can become more aware of how we feel about our bodies, and what our bodies need by reminding ourselves that hunger is not always about food. Food and emotions are deeply connected.
I was force-fed through an IV at a cost of a grand per day to my health insurance carrier. After two three-week stays in the cancer ward, I was released, only to start losing weight again. Fortunately, a member of my oncology team knew exactly what to do about my drastic weight loss. I was urged to get my hands on the real deal -- marijuana.
As a lawyer turned successful restauranteur, my father is by far the hardest-working person I know. And after years of piecing together his dream life, my dad turned out to be, well, my soccer mom.

You've been trying to get pregnant for a year and it's just not happening. It isn't surprising that you may think you are headed straight for IVF since it's the most talked about fertility treatment option. However, your fertility journey will likely begin with tests followed by one of several low tech treatment options.
I'm not surprised when crap is written that perpetuates rape culture. That doesn't make it less important to call out and it certainly doesn't make the discussions that crop up around the idiocy less valid. Which brings us to George Will.
I began to wonder, how many other women had experienced Superhuman Syndrome. What I found was this. I wasn't the only women entrepreneur out there changing their Superhuman ways.

How can we choose happiness when society has programmed us to fear the aging process? Age is a state of mind. If we are always chasing youth, we are stuck in the past. But being stuck in the past only fuels the negative thought patterns in our minds.
All of my hours seem to be running together these days. I used to think that my life was unstructured and spontaneous, but that's not the truth.
What is the greatest part about not having a boyfriend? It's understanding that you do not require one to be complete.

When a teenage girl gets pregnant, it is often the fault of an adult male. You would not know it from reading most of the government reports and scientific publications, but teen impregnation involves men, too -- not just teenage girls and not even just teens.
Affiliating Wendy Davis with Barbie attempts to transform a political leader into a vapid and empty-headed doll famous for her over-sexualized body. The pink Barbie-like frame of the poster plays up girlhood and downplays womanhood.
For me, as a leader and an executive, what you see is what you get. I either put my whole self in, or I take my whole self out. And yes, sometimes, I shake it all about. For me, that's what it's all about. I'm not apologizing.
I am not arguing that we should throw away the very virtues that are found within the feminine and masculine categories. I say we should stop distinguishing between \masculine virtues\ and \feminine virtues.\
It's no longer acceptable to condemn individual behavior without looking at the culture that protects and promotes it.

I recently sat down with Joy Hoover, Founder of The Cupcake Girls, a non-profit that brings non-judgmental support, consistent caring, community resources, peace, love, and cupcakes to women in the adult entertainment industry.

It seems something happened during the female march from rolling pins to corner offices, and I'm not entirely sure it's worth celebrating
Why is this Instagrammer hell-bent on \proving\ that people are lying about what they consume? Picking on individual people for images they uploaded of meals or treats they're about to enjoy sounds a lot like shaming.
Ever find that you have so many ideas you don't know which one to focus on first? That it's hard to prioritize what's important (and what's not), and you just end up feeling stuck in always planning out an idea?
Can we still use the term \slut shaming\ to describe a very specific mindset we see exhibited from sexists so frequently without reclaiming it? When we use this term are we inherently using the language of oppressors?
I love my looks, and quite frankly, I could care less if it matters to anyone else. It took me many years to reach that place of confidence, despite irregular features. But my own concept of beauty allows me to be as beautiful as I want to be, and I've noticed that the world responds on my terms.
If Daisy Miller taught us anything, it's that being seduced by chiseled Italian men will lead to dying from malaria. Lizzie McGuire thought she could prove this b*tch wrong, so she went ahead, fell in love with her own Giovanelli and found that he was actually a fake. Lesson learned, right?

We keep telling ourselves that we should be flawless. When our lives falls short of our imaginary utopia, we get scared and lash out at ourselves and those we love. Our society worships perfection, photoshopping out wrinkles and bulges of our starving models.
\I don't understand. I'd feel better if you wore a reflector.\ It's because you're 6'4\ and 220 pounds and a man. You think about getting hit by a car. I think about being attacked. I think about it every time I step out of the door to run alone... whether at 3:30 a.m. or 3:30 p.m.
If we weren't so distracted by the \outstanding\ as some kind of bizarre yardstick of self-worth measurement, we would appreciate and relish the real, the small and the imperfect.
I have seen how my heart rises and sets with the sun. I wake up in the morning do my visualization and my intention for the day and I feel great and excited my heart feels like it is shining bright and it is time for me to embrace the world.
It might still be a slow slog to the thriving career I am trying to create, but at least now I value myself as a person. I drowned out the voices that were telling me I was an incompetent failure and I won. Because I am a winner and I am here to win!

What does \power\ mean? How do we define it? And how do we need to redefine it again and again in life, as we go, grow, get challenged, fail, learn, succeed, mature?
Who else will tell you it's their loss when you're rejected by a boy or a friend or a publisher? Who else remembers fondly the dance routine you made up to \Cool Rider\ from Grease 2 and will tell you with a straight face that it was a very good performance?
I was the poster child of anarchic identity. I didn't know who I was -- SO I was trying to be everything. I was stressed while working really hard on my medical research, I had a fussy infant, but was also trying to be fit, sexy, and a homemaker at the same time. And it wasn't working.
Always reach out to other people. People like to help people. It makes them feel good. They don't have to give you the time and help -- just the fact that you asked [is important].
While you can't force attraction, there are definitely some things you can do to cultivate it. Personality and conversation are dramatically under-appreciated tools in the toolkit of finding a mate.
I needed to create a trail on this guy. Just in case he did it to someone else, the police would have a record of it. And maybe the next target would be helped. Could be helped. Because they've done it before, and will do it again.
If you've been dishing with your friends about how the guy you're dating \just doesn't get it,\ here's your chance to school him on what women really want.
Because I love my friends and can sit on my married perch and spew advice, I have a few things to say. Not to my amazing friends who are the real deal, the total package, the prize. But for the guys they date. Just a few pointers.

I lift two 8-lb. weights up and down a few times until I notice the people next to me lifting quadruple that amount, practically rolling their eyes at me. By the time I lay down on the mat to do a round of abs, I'm exhausted. I'm closing my eyes and pretending I'm back in Mrs. Kay's kindergarden class and this is nap time.
The entire notion of a \personal self\ vs. a \work self\ - with clear boundaries in between - is fading. There will inevitably be spillover. Research and experience have shown that when employees have opportunities to express who they really are in the workplace, everyone benefits.
Ever have that feeling in your career where there are so many paths you want to pursue and you're pulled in every direction, yet you don't know which one to pick? Maybe you're interested in many different passions, but there aren't enough hours in a day to do all that you wanted.
Even the commercials where the man \gets the girl\ by giving her something sparkly to wear imprints a message that women can be purchased.




When I looked I saw two signs plastered on their building. Two signs that I have probably seen in the past, but ignored. One was of breasts with the word \bumps\ underneath. The other said \Caution Blondes Thinking.\
How do you know the correct message within a breakup speech? How can you tell if it's definitive, or a threat set up as a test?
Being alone does not mean you have to be lonely. And it certainly doesn't mean you have to spend every waking hour looking for someone to share your alone time with.
The silver lining to dating someone who is emotionally and physically abusive is that they've set the bar pretty low. In contrast, everyone else you ever date will seem like Princess Charming. Of course, this silver lining is simultaneously a potential problem.
Hey world hey. It's us, the \Millennials.\ (Which is basically a fancy word for Gen Y/20-somethings/humans who grew up in the 90s/blah blah you get it.) We wanted to take the opportunity to talk about ourselves (shocker!).
if you're looking to change up your date night routine, or add a dash of excitement to your love life, hanging out with other monogamous couples can be just what you need.
f these numbers indicate anything, let it be that we owe the women around us a great deal more support -- and far more opportunities -- than they are currently given.

n a media culture that often dictates, demeans and disenfranchises girls and women, that pits us against one another, infantilizes or downright ignores our imprints on culture, the power of women telling stories should not be underestimated.
In spite of all our vast differences, I related to so many of her words. They made me think about what I can endure, dream, fail at and mercifully still survive

It was one of those icky moments that, if you are a woman, you have likely experienced. It may have been years ago, but it might as well have been yesterday because you still remember it in vivid detail -- including how vulnerable you felt, how powerless you must have seemed.
Strive to become comfortable in your own skin. It's a journey, but having confidence in your decisions, values and who you are as person will help you lead a more fulfilling life.
A mansplainer assumes a woman knows less than he does. A male muter assumes a woman knows less than he does and thus feels no need to explain.
Acceptance is not the same as compliance. It's about experiencing the emotions and trusting that you will bounce back. Ultimately, emotional resilience is about attitude. By focusing on the positive they live more in the solution than the problem. Gratitude does go a long way.
Young women talking about feminism is important. But focusing only on which young, famous women embrace or reject the label of \feminist\ essentially reduces the issue of equal rights to a hashtag.
In the moment when control is lost and the person before you stops becoming human, and becomes your victim. It's never OK for a woman to violently attack a man, just as it is never OK when a man does it. Isn't that what gender equality is all about?
While I'm glad that obsessive-compulsive disorder has emerged in our cultural consciousness and that some realistic depictions of it are being depicted in mass media, it's extremely annoying how often I hear people claim that they are sooooo OCD over some tiny little quirk.

I hate these swimsuit guides. They're supposed to \help\ women find a suit that makes them feel like The Princess of the Waterpark, but what they actually do is make women's self-esteem crash and burn before they've even set foot in the badly-lit dressing room at Macy's.

When the Tony awards are presented June 8, the names of many dazzling actresses will be announced. As for women behind the scenes?  Not so much.



You can be a poker or an asker... or you could be a human being and pick up the phone or send a person a message and say, \Hi, how are you? I'd really love to catch up.\


No matter your rung on the corporate ladder, many people, especially women, engage in some sort of career self-sabotage, from small insidious mistakes to fireworks that can dominate water cooler conversation for weeks.
I want to share a set of realizations that have quite literally changed my life in the last few months. I learned some of these from others, but each one resulted in a pivotal aha moment that changed the way I see myself as a woman, wife, and mother.
How do we learn what it means to really fall in love? More simply put, who teaches us how to actually date?

When it to comes to juggling work and life schedules, many partners feel like ships passing in the night. Whether it's business travel, long hours at the office or family responsibilities that are keeping your schedules out of sync, at some point, it's bound to start wearing on you.
Pretending there is not a difference between male and female executives does not help empower women nor allow them to overcome the necessary roadblocks to achieve greater success. Organizations that understand this will be the catalyst for positive change.
As a man who is on the verge of turning 32-years-old, it seems that not a month goes by where somebody isn't asking me when I am getting married. No matter how many times I am asked this question with a judgmental undertone lurking beneath, I always have the same response.
Beyonc\u00e9 is all about control, and because of that she may be the best entertainer on the planet right now. Sensuality can be about control, sex can be about control, but the idea of losing yourself in another person -- I don't get that when I listen to Bey.
There are poses beside the limo. In the limo. On top of the limo. There are solo poses. Group poses. Date poses. And then a nice mixture of all the aforementioned. There are poses by ponds with ducks. Poses with duck faces. This picture extravaganza is not just limited to prom night.
The feminism I believe in is about choice; I want to be able to choose what I do with my life, how I look and what I choose to wear and yet still be taken seriously. That's because I want to choose not to be considered just for my looks but also for my intelligence.

In the United Sates, one out of every three women has had an abortion. If you are a women living in Texas and a growing number of states, access to this basic, simple and safe procedure has been severely restricted.
When I say I want him to be funny, I mean I want a man with the wit to examine situations, find the humor in them and share them with me.
More degrees often means feeling more shackled to a job and career. You feel pressured to \meet your full potential\ (and pay off debt) instead of feeling free to take a chance. I am a big believer in never picking a job based on building a resume or because it's what everyone expects of you.
This is still a complex issue. One person, one experience, like seeing Lupita on a cover, cannot undo hundreds of years of an internalized issue.  Just like anything else, it is going to take time.
Three years of failed fertility treatments makes you re-think a few things. If I used a donor egg, would I love that child any less? If I carry that baby for nine months, can anyone tell me it's not mine? Do I think my kid is going to care that mommy needed a little help to bring him or her into the world?
What is happening to these young women is nothing new. They are victimized because they are girls. This happens every day all over the world.
When it comes to mating, we apparently value Mama's opinion more than our Dear Old Dad's, our besties and even our pets.
\There is no job that will give you AS much joy as motherhood because there's such great risk involved and in life we know that without great risk there is no great reward.\


My advocacy has taken many forms but is mostly based on doing what sexual abusers hate the most. I talk about it because I have learned that doing so is the most immediate and effective way to unempower abusers.
Jess went to Beijing without knowing a word of Mandarin, winging it all the way, while Rachel planned and plotted for months before hopping on her carefully-chosen Air France flight to Paris. We're both adamant that our own methods are the best way to approach life and moving abroad.
\Not to be all 'vulnerable',\ we'd say with air quotes and then relay some vague truth about our lives or feelings. It was a tactic to avoid the messy emotions roiling beneath our skin, mostly asking, \Am I enough?\
Although the White House tackling sexual assault is a victory for advocates for sexual assault survivors and prevention, the way the task force is framing this issue is fundamentally flawed.  This PSA, while an honorable effort, promotes an extremely patriarchal view of women
Both successful businesses and actually making your dreams come true takes action, dedication, focus and time. Only time can give you what you need. So roll up your sleeves and have fun on the adventure of life. Those who embrace the journey are the ones who see the huge results.
Once I hit my \mid-twenties,\ these announcements trickled in slowly, and then, all at once. Sometimes it seems like not a week goes by where I don't hear about someone I know getting engaged and/or married.

Certainly, there are enough choices available within \mom\ fashion that allows us to look casual, comfortable, and attractive at appealing prices. We needn't break the bank to look good as moms.  All we need do is to take pride in ourselves as irreplaceable souls to so many and then find an outfit that reflects this \true\ beauty.
Step outside and do something that makes you feel good. There are many ways we can explore our beautiful side, sometimes it just means us reminding ourselves of the things that make us unique.
While aging is not often considered a positive factor for women in the dating game, mothers fare better as they age.
What is the right number of friends for you, has that number changed over your life and have you found yourself wanting more friendships?
I feel nothing makes the advice distinctly applicable to women in their early 20s. The advice can always apply to just about anyone until now. Here is a list of what women in their early 20s should be doing.
It's okay to do life backwards, or sideways, or weirdly. It is, after all, your life.
Just as raising children is a collective effort, making sure their moms survive is a task that we all have a responsibility to share.
In the spirit of honoring mothers every day, not just on mother's day, I asked individuals from around the world to share with me, wisdoms from their mothers. Not surprisingly, they confirm how unrelenting and influential our mothers are globally.
But in a world that so desperately needs love, perhaps the fact that there is a woman in the world who has hugged an estimated 33 million people, who shows no signs of stopping and who gives tirelessly of herself in pursuit of a vision for a better world is miracle enough.
What happens when you became your own enemy? What happens where you fail to save yourself from the very darkness you created?
Our stories are probably less dramatic, but no less significant. And as we recover the dreams of our own lost childhoods, we can commit ourselves to expanding the rights and restoring the dignity of every child on this planet.
Anorexia is a life-long battle, and I know that I will always be in recovery. But I also know that I have achieved an incredible feat in beating this horrendous disease. And for that, I have finally gained happiness.
To the outside world, blogging can seem like a solitary endeavor with millions of writers sitting alone filling computer screens with words. But blogging is just partly about writing; it is really about making connections. You put your soul on your blog, and people respond.
A small victory for reproductive justice


Sometimes, it seems as though at every major moment of my life, cupcakes were present. They were eaten on every birthday and anniversary, each sick day and summer vacation. They were even in her hospital bag when I was born, smushed in between diapers and a change of clothes.
The first lesson that my Ima taught me was that family isn't defined by location. And that home isn't permanent and can be created between any four walls. I followed her lead in this and today live a plane flight away. I'm not sure she's thrilled that this a lesson I gleaned. It wasn't an intentional one.
This Mother's Day, as we celebrate the women who sacrifice so much to support their families and give their kids a chance to live the American dream, we must demand that our leaders step up to the plate and do their part to lift up America's mothers.

Get on board with your mom's humanity, flaws and all. Once you do, you'll probably love her even more completely.
Today, in our interconnected world, our lives may be lived through the stories we tell others about ourselves, but forever, and always, my smile will be my mother's smile. The hand raised high to wave hello or goodbye is also hers. My feet even slip into the same shoe size my mother wore.

I believe you can change the world through sex. My team and I are working to make sex better for all of us and to provide a healthy, real-world counterpoint to the ubiquitous influence of porn. The world of business and tech is doing everything it possibly can to stop us.


In the years since my mom died, I watched my friends rely on their own moms to help care for their young children, seek advice and tell them every once in a while that they were doing a good job. I don't think anyone ever told me that. I knew mom would have, but where the hell was she?
The only reason we perpetuate these restrictions is to bring some sense of order to our own worlds. We enjoy the comfort of categorizing people. Grown women make decisions for themselves -- not for other women nor based on other women.

He's stuck in 1999 and only has a beeper. I'll start with this one because it's really, truly, the most unlikely reason. Yet, when you are running through different potential play-by-plays as to why someone didn't ask for your number, you'll always start with the most absurd possibility.
On top of being mean, they're smooth as hell; often the only evidence you'll have that you've even been hit by one of these barracudas is a strong feeling of bad about yourself. Here's a recipe for getting your bearings after a sneak attack.

Our foremothers didn't blaze the trail so that I could become a stressed-out, harried, working mom, speeding her way through life, putting herself and others in danger. That humbling truth landed with a sting. My margin for error was too tight. I was not thriving, I was barely surviving.

In most countries, girls outperform boys in math. However, in the US, boys uniformly best girls. We are joined in the low-performing bottom three by Liechtenstein and Columbia.  While we have the greater problem that math and science education in the US seriously lags that of other nations, we must face the fact that that lag is also the product of gender inequities.
The fictional \girl next door\ should be the girl changing the world with all the geekiness, creativity and overwhelming drive she can muster -- sparkly things optional, but strongly encouraged.

We have been able to make these situations work because frankly, I'd rather be part-time with him than be full-time with anyone else. Through this time, we learned that as a couple we can weather anything. We are together because we want to be -- not because we need to be with someone.

We need to raise the minimum wage to at least $10.10 to help hardworking families who are struggling to scrape by. In tough economic times, there are few policies that could have as immediate, and as dramatic, of a boost for American workers, particularly for women of color.
Yes, I know the title is a bit jarring... but then, again, that's the point. One in every three American women will die of heart disease; that means one woman every minute. That means someone you know... or maybe even you.
I am very conflicted about the tattoo. Because I'm a fashion and corporate rebel, many are surprised there's not some ink lurking under my R13 Jeans.
How about all of us in the entrepreneurship ecosystem look inward to understand our personal money story and shift the narrative of our time?

Recently, Phyllis Schlafly emerged from her 1950s time capsule with both hot glue guns blazing. She took aim at the issue of income inequality and the proposed legislation to address the problem.
People were passing by, staring in awe at the scene that was taking place in front of them. Their heads turned sideways as they glanced back at me in horror and surprise. A few people even slowed down to watch him throw me to the ground. But not a single one of them stopped. No one came to help. I was alone.
I am more comfortable in my own skin, calmer about the challenges I face and able to function better in my relationships in my personal and professional life. I also look a hell of a lot better because I have more money than I did at 20!
Please, for the love of God, know that sex is normal and natural. Please do not feel shame if you end up giving in to normal biological urges, but before you do please seek out comprehensive information on sex, contraception, and protection.
Even in the face of stereotypes and structural barriers there just may be one profound solution to our ambition, performance and confidence waning in situations where we don't feel like we fit in.
While planning a pregnancy can be an excitingly blissful time, it can also be extremely stressful when it's not happening as quickly as you'd hoped. But agonizing over not getting pregnant can be the exact thing that's keeping you from conceiving.
I am not saying you should excuse yourself for bad behavior, but you should never let your mistakes take over. You should have an immense amount of self-love because you are your greatest ally. You know your own heart better than anyone.
In our New Jersey attic, there is precisely one hat, standing in immense and ghostly isolation beneath a tent of blue Indian gauze, its custom-made hat-stand crafted by a friend in Up-country South Carolina about 20 years ago.
Getting ready to go out officially begins after showers, and then it's time to get serious about fun.

Conventional definitions of success have us chasing our tails. Contemporary outlooks will have us living in truth. This new perspective of success has to include the intangibles of happiness and purpose. Only in these pursuits can the experience of authentic joy be attained.
The sad truth is that both writers at National Review and The Nation share an idealized, fairy-tale conception sex -- though, of course, the details differ -- along with a ruthless impulse to shame and stigmatize the men and women who deviate from their scripts.
In 2013 women became eligible for the same combat opportunities as men in the armed services. President Obama has advocated vigorously for women in combat, and the goal is for the Armed Services to fully integrate women into all spheres by January 1, 2016.
Of the many powerful women who have graced the cover of TIME magazine in it's near century existence, only one was in her underwear.
Now's the time to de-clutter your love life, so let's clean out what's not working and get some fresh perspective. Here are several great tips to sweep away the old and make room for an awesome fresh start.
We have a national problem with not expecting or teaching boys to control themselves when they are quite clearly biologically capable of doing so.  That's a gap no one is talking about on Sunday morning news programs.

To talk about late-night texting etiquette is to talk about flimsy sober intentions, so weak they crumble after one whiskey sour and a guy who has the same name as your ex.

Nearly every woman I know has a story of being harassed, followed, threatened, frightened or raped. In 100 percent of these cases these women, however they may have been dressed, whatever state of sobriety or inebriation they were in, whether they were \slatternly\ or well-groomed, were not \asking for it.\
How much of our moods and attitudes are dependent on weather conditions (and other stuff)? For example, I visited Central Park in NYC a couple of weekends ago. There was barely a square inch left un-occupied on that sunny, spring afternoon. \The New York state of mind\ was mellow, light, and breezy -- not always an attitude associated with the typical New Yorker.

\What makes you think this guy might be gay?\ In the last five years, I have never heard a good answer. Then I will call on common sense
\Frolic in his chest hairs.\
Like the slow shift of the female body in media, I hope to see more realistic sex when it is necessary and holds significance to the film. Too many movies incorporate sex and women's bodies without explaining the purpose of it.


It's no longer a two-drink minimum for you. It's a two-drink maximum, or else you'll be snoozing on top of the marble slab bar before midnight.
I cannot begin to describe the way my heart overflows with love -- from strangers, friends, fellow bloggers, fans and laughter on a daily basis just by being intertwined with my tribe of writers.
The widespread cultural belief in \soul mate ideology\ undermines our chances at happiness because it makes us passive receivers of idyllic romantic expectations.
I valued being independent but hated the thought that my options were to either let my relationship define me (from my grandmother's generation) or be so tough I only attracted a man who followed me around like a lost puppy (the wounded feminine from my mother's generation).

We believe we can do everything ourselves because we have Google. Because if we desire human interaction, we have our online dating inbox. And when we don't, when we'd rather not make small talk with a guy at a bar, we just say no, thanks and binge on \House of Cards.\
In comparing the results of the student and alumni surveys, both future as well as current lawyers see billable hour requirements as a major factor in a firm's level of family friendliness
or some reason, there are no tears. Just anger. White hot anger. And if anyone near you is pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant or even just talking about children, you're not responsible for your actions.
Truth be told, it's not really about the couch or the house or the vase with the fake flowers in it; it's about emotionally combining. It's about figuring out how to rearrange my life to allow another human being to come in.
The true healing of an emotional eater takes years.  No one wants to hear that, but it's the truth.  And when I realized I could diet no more forever, I started to heal the things that really mattered. Like friendships.
While we were \just friends,\ I'd seen names of girls flash on the screen and he'd turn his phone over the same way I would when one of my texting guys would pop up on my screen. I knew there were some girls out there still hoping... still flirting and texting.
In the ongoing Mommy Wars, the stay-at-home mother has been, at turns, revered and demonized. But there's a third reality that rarely enters the discussion
While you can't force attraction, there are definitely some things you can do to cultivate it. Personality and conversation are dramatically underappreciated tools in the toolkit for finding a mate.
Women wield a big purse -- and it's getting bigger. Around the globe, women create, control and influence about a quarter of the world's wealth -- upwards of $20 trillion.
I will always remember the first time I shored up the courage to give the nosey person a steely look and replied, \It's complicated.\
