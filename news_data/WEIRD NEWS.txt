The history of the female gurgitator is a short one. From Japan, Takako Akasaka once ate 90 ostrich egg omelets.

I'm kind of cynical. So I figured I'd been had. The old man walked out with the antique lamp. And the clerk looked at me to pay for it. How did I end up in this mess? I guess it started with stress.













My friends now like to sneak in my name in karaoke with \I Kissed a Girl.\ If I protest, it becomes a big deal and draws attention. But the one time I went along with it, the DJ complimented my \impersonation.\
