I\u2019m a high school English teacher and the most important question I\u2019m asked each year has nothing to do with reading or writing
Dear Teacher, As you head back to school, I see you so fresh and eager, and I am so thankful for your energy. \u00a0Your profession
Special education should be a service for children, not a place they are sent.
The arts are vital for everyone. Art can soothe us. And it can stretch us -- by exposing us to concepts we've never imagined before, or by leading us to wrestle with ambiguity, multiple interpretations or artistic expression that we find jarring.
Children are being Tasered by school-based police officers. No one knows how often it\u2019s happening or what impact it\u2019s having on students.
In the next couple of weeks, teachers where you live will come back from the beach or the mountains or their gardens or their

There remains an enormous gulf between the severity of the climate crisis and the attention given the crisis in U.S. schools and in widely used text material.

Misguided state education policy extends further than just the budget.




Lisa Barnshaw reminds us why amazing teachers are so important.
Over 155 million Americans play video games, and spend upwards of 3 billion hours per week engrossed in a game.



At Oberlin, it started in December, when the temperatures ran high, although the weeping willows and the yellow poplars that


The American Federation of Teachers reached a significant milestone this week
A few days ago, a story came across my news feed that I was sure was not true. Apparently, a school district in North Carolina has changed their handbook so that high schoolers are allowed to carry pepper spray with them to school.
Watch TV, see friends, read books and eat ice cream!

Instead of wishing for change in the world, he is making change, and the formula he shares with others is simple; seize the opportunity to lead, innovate, find your passion, and resonate. He's Thomas McGovern, a leader in change.
If we know better, why do so many of us act as if things like love, motivation, self-esteem, and internalization come in only one variety? Might we focus on how much of \it\ someone has because of our culture's preoccupation with quantification and data?
The last 15 years have been marked by top-down education policies that promoted testing over teaching, competition over collaboration, austerity over investment, and scapegoating teachers rather than valuing them. The Every Student Succeeds Act, the new federal education law, moves us in the right direction, but past policies have left their mark.

People who insist that bigotry is mere ignorance are mistaken, albeit hopeful. If bigotry were mere ignorance, its practitioners would reform upon being educated. But there are too many troubling instances in which bigots prove incorrigible.
Imagine a world where a poem was judged by the number of characters per line or the font in which it was published, or a violin concerto reviewed in terms of its precise conformance to metronomic beats or the posture of the violinist. This is what we are doing to education

That was the compelling question I heard at the recent Advancing Justice conference in Los Angeles. I doubt there is an answer, a satisfactory answer anyway. But above all, I appreciate the discussion, and, because a certain response would be more confident than correct, I offer a set of observations.
There has never been a lower percentage of college freshmen interested in teaching. I'm not sure that anybody is surprised by the collapse of the teacher pipeline. But for the sake of completeness, let's rattle off most likely culprits for those people who are actually uncertain how such a thing could happen.
There has never been a more critical time to support the widespread establishment of collegiate recovery programs (CRPs)
I am ticked off whenever it occurs

Perhaps you remember Corinthian Colleges. It was the country\u2019s second largest chain of for-profit colleges, before it collapsed

Some people seem to be drawn to technology for its own sake -- because it's cool. This strikes me as an unpersuasive reason to spend oodles of money, particularly since the excitement is generated and continually refreshed by companies that profit from it.
Too many students don\u2019t have the resources they need. Today, we start to change that.
They are private citizens who get to spend taxpayer dollars to educate children. They argue that the market will determine success.  Unfortunately, they get to define what success looks like -- not the public whose taxes fund the school, nor voters who are the ultimate policy makers in a democratic society.
On the playing field, Hank Aaron smashed through racial barriers and ignored racist death threats and hate mail when he broke Babe Ruth's long time \sacred record\ for home runs on April 8, 1974.
Since taking their oath, many governors have begun to close public schools.  By violating their oath in so public a manner, they have shown that perjuring themselves means nothing to them, as does the fact that their first act in office was an act of perjury.
The screenings still take place despite turning up few weapons and a major drop in crime rates.

Your 20s can be a decade-long stint in the waiting room of life. However it is important to point out that your 20s isn't a throwaway decade. What you do matters allot. Here are 9 ways to make the most of these exciting but unsettled years
This new law can create positive change. States will now take the lead on accountability, interventions and teacher evaluation systems. While some states will mess up, we hope most will learn from the failures of NCLB and give teachers and schools the latitude and support to deeply engage students and to focus on the whole child.
At this point, the debate in America about art and science is coming to a conclusion 
I will be glad to see NCLB left behind and RTTT stopped, but I do not see how ESSA is a victory for education in the United States. Does anyone believe that low-funded poorly performing states like Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, New Mexico and West Virginia, will create meaningful accountability systems and tests that will expose the low quality public education they offer Black and Latino students?



Graduates with master's degrees in fine arts, education, business administration or social work also stand to save thousands of dollars.
In Washington, D.C. earlier this month, The Ovation Foundation, the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities and Americans for the Arts met to formally recognize 10 schools who \use the arts to make STEM  subjects more accessible and engaging to students and are able to mutually strengthen arts and STEM learning.\

I think there are plenty of reasons to oppose national standards no matter what standards they are, and plenty of reasons to believe that no set of national standards will ever accomplish any of the goals set for them. But let's set all of that aside for a moment and talk about how the very attempt to assess standards-based outcomes ruins those standards.
As their application numbers collapsed in recent years, a good number of law schools were forced to choose between their
Also, nearly half of school districts wait months to get test results back.
The presumption of innocence, the benefit of the doubt, walking without worrying -- these should not be hallmarks of white privilege. They are human rights that should be enjoyed by all.
The recent series of shootings on college campuses reminded me of how fragile our \civilization\ really is, hanging by a thread of \normalcy.\
Like many women today, I wear several different hats. I was the African girl child and now am an African woman, mother to the African girl child whose plight and potential I consider my own.
Young people have shown how hard they are willing to work to claim their right to education. Now we all must work harder to make sure that we target those left behind so that all children and young people everywhere have equal opportunities no matter where they live.
There have been some positive changes, but Newark has a long way to go.
Donald Trump may be a big blowhard, espousing his belief that there's a link between vaccines and autism based on no medical facts. But with the bully pulpit he has, he can influence parents to not vaccinate their children and the price could be deadly.
\We didn't want to strike, and it seems to be the only way to have a dialogue with our senior administration.\
In union there is strength. That was why it is so sad that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, i.e. Scott Walker lite, and the Obama administration help pave the way for his union-bashing and did little to help working people in the Wisconsin recall campaigns.
Every parent who is looking for better quality in child care also owes Gwen a profound thank you.  For ten years -- between 1985 and 1995 -- Gwen compiled annual reports on each states' child care licensing standards.


Bottom line is that we simply don't know the future, and bureaucratic and highly regulated education systems are inherently inapt to respond to imminent learning opportunities and other emerging circumstances connected to the digital age.
On August 7, 2015 Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the ALST, the latest rendition of the Pearson/New York State Education Department literacy test for teacher certification candidates, does not discriminate against minority group members
My students are left facing a quandary
The right repayment plan for you will depend on your income, credit history and many other factors such as your ability to support higher monthly repayments. This article looks at how to pick the best student loan repayment plan for you.
Through the union, educators are raising our collective voice. Together with parents and students, educators are turning the tide.  Teaching is our heart. Our students are our soul. And the union is our spine. When educators raise their voice and their power, we can reclaim the promise of public education.
For some graduates, paying off their student debt just became a gamble. Student loan debt has become an increasingly pressing crisis in the past several years, with politicians all suggesting solutions to help graduates pay off their student loans. New Jersey Assemblyman John Burzichelli recently proposed a student loan debt lottery.
Rereading Jonathan Kozol's Death at an Early Age on the 50th anniversary of his firing from the Boston Public School System is to be forced to confront the unrelenting horror of school segregation.
If you are a teacher or studying to be a teacher, you might be concerned about paying back your student loans. Even for the most frugal planners, student loan debt is a reality that many students and graduates face today.
As unpopular as I feel this may sound, I think we, as teachers, must recognize aspects of how we have traditionally gone about our work that has contributed to this sentiment. I see three main issues
It's no secret that most college graduates need student loans to help pay for college. In fact, many students take out multiple student loans with differing repayment terms. That's why it'simportant to understand what loans you're signing your name to.
If you are having trouble paying a student loan due to financial hardship or special life circumstances, you might qualify for a student loan deferment. The student loan deferment process is quite simple for the right individuals.
With the reauthorization of the absurd and dysfunctional NCLB, we have a chance to once again let teachers teach and let students learn. We have a chance to ignite their imaginations, encourage them to reach their full potential, and expand their world view beyond filling in bubble tests with a #2 pencil.
Recently, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce released some findings about what new graduates could expect to earn. The results are interesting and may well speak to where the workforce will head if left to market forces.
Finding ways to help save on your student loan repayment can save a lot of time and stress when managing your student loans. Take the time to clarify these commonly misunderstood repayment strategies.
I'm not naive. I know that Sanders is a seasoned politician, that he didn't get where he is by being an amateur bumpkin. His ideas are going to have to be put forth and examined. I know he's not Superman or a knight on a white steed. But I also know Vermont, and I know slickness will only get you so far there.
A leader of a college or university (or any non-profit, for that matter) should do what one can for those who work at the institution. One thing one can do at no cost is simply to be appreciative of hard work and to thank people for their work. Doing so goes a long way, a very long way.
What if we tied public funding for community colleges and technical schools to their job-placement rates?
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA is available to anyone who is considering graduate or undergraduate studies in the United States. The FAFSA is used by colleges and universities to determine eligibility for student aid.
Post-college graduation is the first time that many graduates will have to be financially responsible and fully support themselves. Part of that responsibility includes paying off their student loans.

I recently attended the 21st Century Children's Nonfiction Conference where the conversation encompassed all things nonfiction from writing it to publishing it to teaching it. What interested me most was what I knew least. How can gifted teachers use nonfiction in the classroom?
Education changes lives and puts the American Dream within reach for millions of people. We see this every day at City Colleges of Chicago, a system of seven community colleges that has set a high bar for the success of every student, and accepts no excuses for failure.
Last week's Curios covered why we forget things when we walk through doorways, the purpose of goosebumps, and a Russian village where every resident can walk a tightrope.
Many reformsters have one fundamental point in common
Adults have always bemoaned the moral decay of the younger generation. And they keep getting it wrong.
At the heart of the disagreement is whether the law should include meaningful accountability for the nation's most at-risk students. A group of effective classroom teachers from across the country is joining the fray with a powerful -- and perhaps unexpected -- message.
By refusing to take into account several factors which impede student learning and over which teachers have no control, this policy is, in essence, a punitive measure, a political weapon, a pre-emptive strike against teachers, intended to demoralize and drive them out of the teaching profession.
High school exchanges participants make a profound impact not only on their host families, schools, and communities, but ultimately on overall relationships with the citizens and governments of their countries.
I watched as my students picked up their cap and gown and carried it in their arms like a newborn baby. I smiled, said a few last words of encouragement, then asked, \You graduated... now what?\
In service of this cause, I offer a series of true stories -- acknowledging that for almost all of us our understanding of complex social phenomenon comes down to our own anecdotes.
Well, that was too much for Ken Ham. Denying there was a real Noah's Ark and being a libertine? Calling Noah's Flood a fairy tale and being open-minded?
Student loan refinancing is a great way to potentially save you money and lower your monthly payments. Refinancing is the process of consolidating your existing loan(s) into a new loan with a lower interest rate and a different term.
The notion of robots largely replacing humans -- while true in some job sectors (e.g., automobile assembly) -- is still more metaphor than omnipresent reality. It is what robots symbolize that are the real threat to today's workforce.
The Institute of Medicine reports that students in kindergarten through 12th grade get only four to six hours of nutrition education per school year. In a culture where more than a third of young Americans are obese, it's worth looking at what helps these students retain the information they need to maintain a healthy weight.
In this post, I will share many of the early academic indicators of kindergarten readiness. The list is by no means comprehensive, but it will provide families with an understanding of what will be expected of their child and offer tips to help them prepare their child for a successful transition to kindergarten.
For many students, graduate school is a more focused version of college. You'll get specialized training in the industry you want to work in, plus the benefits of professional connections and credentials beyond a bachelor's degree.
A federal loan consolidation works differently than private loan consolidations. With a federal loan consolidation, all of your eligible federal loans are combined into one loan with a lower monthly payment. Borrowers can consolidate their loans after they graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment.
There are two different loan rates to choose from when financing student loans
As we fight our way back from the recession, it's clear that our economy isn't working for everyone. Too many don't have the skills they need for the jobs available. As a union, the AFT takes on these issues. This work isn't loud or provocative, but it's vital for our communities and our nation.
I know the students worked hard, but perhaps Class of 2015 shouldn't refer to any student who finished any grade this year. Let's save the pomp and circumstance for just one very special circumstance
Sometimes the magic and beauty of the classroom, the soaring beyond simple skills and content, happens in the most unexpected ways. At these moments, we are experiencing a kind of performance art in the classroom.
Way back in 2001, when we were all a lot younger and more na\u00efve, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). It had all kinds of ideas in it, some better than others. The emphasis on research was certainly novel, and even revolutionary in many ways.
Repaying medical school loans can be a long and tedious process, but if you are proactive about your loans you can save thousands of dollars over the course of your repayment.
I remember sending my first text and opening my first MySpace account. I was 13 years old. Even though the smart phone was not in existence, my world of communication was forever changed.
As I have written before, the United States is experiencing profound, continuous, and accelerating change as the country makes a transition from a national, analog, industrial economy to a global, digital information economy.
Only if we humans commit to continuously redesigning ourselves, adapting and improving as conditions around us change, persisting in the face of whatever happens, will there be critical roles for us in the dynamic technology-driven new economies, as well.
Teachers have to be allowed to teach and sensitive subjects must be allowed to be breached. Sandy Hook was a tragic event that no one wishes to see happen again, but we should also never forget.
If you have a federal student loan, you may be curious about your repayment options. Luckily, federal student loans are most beneficial to those needing repayment assistance; the majority of these plans will help you lower your monthly payment at the expense of extending your loan term several years.
In view of the fact that many states in America now evaluate teachers on their students' performance, I wish to suggest five proposals that, if adopted by the appropriate agencies, would transform our country and, if adopted by other nations, would change the world.
After hearing the \good news\ of the high school graduation rate nationally -- over 81 percent -- I recalled a blog I wrote for Huffington Post four years ago.
This morning, I want to talk about money. I'm not referring to financial literacy, and no, I'm not planning to lament the pursuit of the almighty dollar or even discuss the subject of materialism at all.
If you have graduated from college and have thought about consolidating or refinancing your student loans, you may be wondering what possible interest rate you can get. If you are still in school and need a private student loan, you may find yourself in the same situation.

Striving Readers was a serious, well-meaning attempt to solve a very important problem faced by far too many secondary students
Failure seems to be all the rage these days. Fail fast. Fail smart. Fail forward. It's hard not to gag on the plethora of \failure\ clich\u00e9s that headline cultural media today. My 6-year-old daughter is even wrapped up in the topic.
After spending many wonderful years in our church preschool, it was time for my daughter to transfer to public school. As any mom can attest to, this can be an emotional time. When you have a child with special needs, it can be unnerving.
I've been spending time in Dubai with students and others involved in developing the next generation of the region's journalists. Everyone means well and is working hard, but I sense that these young people may slip into old patterns.
Viruses are formidable, but they're not omnipotent, malevolent, or infinitely malleable. They are subject to the same evolutionary constraints as any other biological entity, notably, they cannot \try\ to become more virulent, or gain a set of mutations because they \need\ them in order to switch hosts.
It's vital that we offer quality real-world learning and enrichment opportunities to all kids to reduce the time kids spend playing on their phones.

Let's stop making college into something it's not. It's not a stand in for parenting. It's not a guarantee for success nor a ticket to happiness. It's a campus, some classes, peers galore. It's a great privilege, an opportunity and a financial decision.
The day has finally come - you have been accepted to college and cannot wait to start working on your degree. The only thing that stands between you and your future is figuring out how you will pay for the hefty price tag that comes with a college education.
Finding the right private student loan for you will help you fund your college degree with the best terms and with the lowest interest rate possible. Many students turn to private loans after they have exhausted all of their federal options.
Those currently in repayment often opt into automatic payments to make life easier and to take advantage of a rate reduction. Although this passive option provides some student loan relief, there are options that could potentially save you a lot of money and shave a few years off of your repayment terms.
Summertime is perfect for supplementing your children's education with entrepreneurship.
If you are leaving your job to return back to school and are still paying on your undergraduate loans, consider refinancing them while your income is strong. Some refinancing lenders will allow for an education deferment while you return to graduate school.
Every June, I suffer from what I call a teacher hangover. It sticks around for about a week. There are some telltale signs that I have yet again succumbed to the condition.

Innovation within proven programs can be a good thing, when schools have fully embraced and thoroughly understand a given program and now can see where it can be improved or adapted to their circumstances.  However, innovation too early in replication is likely to turn the best of innovations into mush.
Surveys of potential home buyers, particularly first time buyers, are telling us that many could use a little more knowledge about two of the largest costs of ownership. Everyone needs a mortgage and insurance is necessary as well.
As the school year is coming to a close, access to affordable early education and child care is still on the mind of many parents. More than 23,000 children from across Massachusetts are being left behind, sitting on waitlists for enrollment in quality early education and out-of-school time care programs during this most critical stage of their development.
Much has been written about the Baby Boomer generation, as they're coming into retirement now.  Approximately 10,000 boomers hit the age of 65 every day.  The boomer years are from 1946 through 1964.  Those born in 1946 turned 65 in 2011, and we've progressed through births in 1949.
After graduation, student loan management is the last thing you want to think about. If you have landed your first full-time job, the reality of paying back your student loans is right around the corner. If you have been out several years, this is still an opportune time to learn more about your student loans and potentially save money.
The average American college student graduates with several student loans with an average total balance of $29,000 in student loan debt. Each academic year, students need to reapply for new loans to cover the upcoming tuition and school related expenses.
Evaluating teachers on their students' performance is an issue that has elicited much comment of late. In essence, this view assumes that if students aren't learning, the fault lies squarely with their teachers alone.
If we've seen one thing over and over again in this series of stories about influential teachers, it's that a little personal attention and encouragement from a teacher can change the course of a student's life.
I had a dream last night that Justin Bieber visited my class. And offered the most powerful lesson any future teacher could hear.
In May, I continued my conversations with thought leaders from China to New York who sketched out for me the conflicting overlaps between creativity, innovation, reform and testing, and shared their efforts to create coalescence between them.
\Proficient\ is having a moment right now in the education world, so perhaps this is an opportune moment to stop and reflect, to sit and think about how the term, like \all natural\ and \college and career ready,\ doesn't actually mean a thing.
Today my kids learn to deal with equally senseless attacks and murderous individuals. Once again, the vocabulary of measurement is dusted off. They practice the difference between Code Red, Code Green, and Code Yellow, and the instructions Lockdown, Closedown, Closed Campus and Shelter-in-Place.
Title VII of The Civil Rights Act of 1964 created the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to ensure equal, employment advancement for all and makes employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin illegal.
When your child gets an acceptance letter to college, you might feel excited - but also worried about money.
When President Obama recognized May 2015 as National Foster Care Month, his Proclamation honored \those who dedicate themselves to making a difference.\ As the month draws to a close, those of us working in the foster care trenches need to take a hard look at where we are still failing these children.
Real estate investors who have properties in areas requiring flood insurance need to know about changes in the law that went into effect on April 1, 2015. ROI and cash flow considerations make keeping up with cost increases important.
I don't want to make this an article about becoming a super fix & flip guru or even managing your own rental properties. What I want to help investors to do is to look at how they can exit REITs but stay in real estate as an investment asset class.
It's a warm spring evening in Central Park and a group of teens are gathered at the Alice in Wonderland statue, just up from the boating lake. For most of them, frolicking on the iconic statue is probably something they haven't done in a while. But today the teens don't hold back.
When you see students walk the stage at graduation this year, know that behind them is an invisible line of men and women who helped each one to buy hope for themselves and to bet on a future that needs their talent.
Education is about children -- real, living, breathing, complicated, tender, diverse children. There is no model, no assembly line, no template or standard methodology that can serve them well.

Cathy Young's recent piece in the Washington Post, \Feminists want us to define these ugly sexual encounters as rape. Don't let them,\ is the most important piece to appear in the minefield of modern discourse on \affirmative consent.\
HackingFutbol was a great example of what can happen when you bring people together from different backgrounds, making it a truly international collaboration. However, this is not the end of the road for BerkleeICE and beIN SPORTS.

This fall, Volvo will bring its very first facility to North America. South Carolina has become a leader in the emerging auto manufacturing economy, and they're to be lauded for their success in attracting jobs to their state, including BMW and Boeing.
I doubt that Putnam fully realizes how appreciative teachers are of his efforts to shift our toxic education debates to a conversation about the real problem, the opportunity gap. To close the racial and economic achievement gaps, we must regain the confidence required to tackle out-of-school issues as well as in-school issues.
In 2008, Jessica Seinfeld released a cookbook for parents called \Deceptively Delicious.\ At the time, I was a newly-minted mother of a solid-food eating child. Seinfeld's book was all the rage among the other new mothers in my mama tribe. The recipes were \stealthily packed with veggies hidden in them so kids don't even know!\


The internet is blowing up over The Focus Room incident where a parent discovered that their child was being put in this Focus Room for hours on end. Many are reasonably horrified, and I think there is a lot of reason for concern and investigation. However... I can't help but wonder about the other side of the story
Sometime around my fifth birthday, a clipboard-carrying young woman knocked on the door of my mother's shotgun house in our working-class, east Texas town.
Overshadowing this admirable cultural exchange between two global powers are the desperate lengths Chinese students go to ensure a prized spot at an American university.
Near the entrance of Logan Middle School is a statue called \The Doughboy\ -- a World War I soldier carrying a firearm in one hand, and in the other a grenade.
Chicago has been a school reform battlefield for decades. That is why the re-election of Mayor Rahm Emanuel carries with it national implications. In a race mirroring national trends, a centrist big-city Democrat faced off against a progressive challenger attacking him from the left.
Reading Shakespeare, the Greeks, and the classics; reading for life-wisdom, nourishment, guidance and growth; reading to save one's soul and to make sense of oneself and the enigma of life -- this kind of reading rarely exists anymore.
The education world has been buzzing after a segment on John Oliver's Last Week Tonight (warning - adult language) that viciously lampooned standardized testing. It's a funny piece about a serious issue that has polarized parents and lawmakers across the country. Are we testing kids too much?
There's a promise we make to the next generation
The full range of debate about the Big Standardized Tests really comes down to answering two critical questions about the testing
While most of their classmates will be celebrating the end of high school, the beginning of college, and perhaps be a little nervous at living away from home, these one-percenters will be experiencing excitement and some nervousness of an entirely different sort.
We know that empowering youth can be as simple as listening to them. And when youth are actively engaged in a problem that concerns them, outcomes are better.
Why do we have so many children that choose not to read? As I pondered that question, I was watching a children's TV channel and decided to do some informal research. I decided to pay particular attention to the commercials being presented to our children.
Young people almost always know what is going on in the adult world. So, if you want to know what is working in the classroom or in a school, just ask the students.
The phrase \research says\ has been so misused that many teachers cringe when they hear the words. That isn't because helpful research doesn't exist; it's because teachers have been exposed to a lot of bad advice and instruction claiming to be \research-based,\ often in professional-development sessions organized by their principals and superintendents.
I've spent the better part of my career looking at how technology influences kids and teens, and how gender can play a role in media experiences. Of course, we know that awareness for gender equality means being attune to our own personal biases and preferences.
Now, I'm saluting Frances Myers, the teacher that made the difference for me, in the hopes that her granddaughters, my daughter and anyone who's a student, will appreciate all that the best of our teachers do for us.
This year, we have the potential to level the playing field for our low-income children and families. As California's budget surplus continues to soar, policymakers have a choice to make
She teaches her students to listen closely to the rhythm of Shakespeare's words and find meaning in them. She teaches her students to not just find meaning in these ancient texts, but also to find meaning in every day human relationships.
Anyone who thinks that music classes are not as challenging as academic classes has never sat in one of her classes.
Digital media and its impact on education was still in an embryonic phase in the early 1990s when author and edtech pioneer Thomas Whitby received his Masters of Science degree in educational technology.
Resilience is best defined in practice as the ability to recover. It's a hard topic to bring up regarding school violence prevention - no doubt - but important when we can recognize success stories.
As I shared in a post at this time last year, the topic of education always seems to surface when I speak with adult children of all ages about the admiration they have for their mothers.
If it wasn't for them, I would not be graduating from DePauw University in 18 days. While in high school, they offered me so much guidance in my academic life, but even more impactful was the guidance they offered in my personal life.
I always had the feeling that she might have easily been a great writer or leader in any field, but somehow decided to stay in the same classroom for as many years as I have known her, patiently prying young brains with a methodical, calm, questioning style.
I couldn't be more grateful for the teachers who have entered my life and helped to shape me into the person I am.
Teachers are important and have the extreme ability to change a person's life. Mr. Macpherson is a true example of this.
Kelly is the type of educator who calls attention to the aspects of society most people would like to pretend do not exist; the type of educator who cares deeply for her students and their success. Kelly is the type of educator who changes the world, student by student.
I came from a very poor family, on public assistance, and family life was exceedingly dysfunctional. I started 4th grade a day late. I walked into a class full of children I did not know, but it did not matter -- school was my safe place. And Mrs. Harrison was my shelter.
I have experienced many moments of gratitude that have changed my life. Yet as I reflect on these moments, one stands out
It is a critical time for liberal arts institutions that serve this student body to engage in better publicity about the vocational value of the liberal arts. Now, there's a message worthy of a commencement address.
Even if the folks at D.A.R.E. somehow did not realize that this was likely, at best, a satire site, any qualified drug educator should know that the information about marijuana contained in the article is not even close to accurate.
Where student data are concerned, privacy and security are paramount. Information is power, and we need to keep private, personal information out of the wrong hands. But what about getting the right information into the right hands?
I firmly believe that without Lisa, the negative education statistics that plague Latino communities would have become my sobering reality. Instead, Lisa was one of the first people who recognized my potential and instilled in me a passion for learning.
Many more \great students\ could be developed and supported if only their schools allowed their teachers to discover who they really are and nurture their passions. At present we are moving in the opposite direction.
KIPP Schools, Success Academies, Democracy Prep and any number of other \no excuses\ schools are not developing true grit and resilience other than the numb grit required to endure humiliation and the resilience necessary to get up and go to school every day.
In fact, we have no clear, complete, scientifically supported picture of what a college ready student looks like, nor any proven way to measure the complex of qualities (that we still can't name and quantify). Standardized test scores are not a proxy, not even a bad one
Today, the educational evangelist, speaker and author travels the globe to explain how technology and social media can best be incorporated within classroom instruction.
If reformers want to hold us accountable for each child, wouldn't we have to hold them accountable for every child damaged by their policies? Wouldn't we end up in an even greater education civil war? Or maybe we should...
Summer vacation is supposed to be a time of camps, family vacations and growth experiences for students and their families. But the massive opt out movement of last April has led to a confusing collapse of summer traditions.

This Friday May 1st, more than 400 events across the nation have been planned to celebrate College Signing Day. These events will acknowledge students' decisions to pursue their education beyond high school.
Our public institutions are strengthened, not weakened, when workers exercise their rights. I wish executives could see that a voice at work for educators fortifies the school, bringing the intellectual assets of teachers and staff to school decision-making.

Owning rental property has been a path to riches for a great many investors. Rental property is funding awesome retirement lifestyles as well. We've also been enjoying a surge in rental demand and rents since the recovery began after the crash in 2007.
My suggestions are most easily applied in settings where both teachers and students have considerable autonomy, but I hope these ideas may be useful to teachers even in traditional settings.
I LOVE real estate and every facet of real estate investment. From wholesaling and flipping houses to rental property ownership, there's opportunity for profit in every market, whether rising, falling, or sitting still.

Based on our work, we have developed standards and criteria for parents and community leaders to quickly gauge the quality of the STEM education programs in their community.
Even though Hochul was listed separately on the ballot in the primary, Weingarten acknowledged in her September 8, 2014, robocall that she was performing the call on behalf of the Democratic Party -- and the Democratic Party considered Hochul to complete the Cuomo re-election ticket.

It is vital that educators be trained to recognize and nurture self-directed learning using technology and be capable of creating learning environments that support it.
For growing teens, this daily trudge is more than a minor annoyance. Countless studies and medical experts are sounding the alarm (no pun intended)
Brand names do not necessarily maximize student's financial success. If financial success is not driving the mania behind college admissions competitiveness, then what is?
Zakaria is a compelling spokesman for the Liberal Arts. He shows unequivocally their importance in the cultural, economic and developmental world and how our world becomes threatened by the narrow focus of Manichean politics.

There has been lots of talk the past few years about the coming \disruption\ in higher education. Technology, critics suggest, will present traditional colleges and universities with daunting challenges. Some have estimated that half will be forced to close their doors in the next 15 years.
We have at our doorstep, a once in a century opportunity for education in America. Almost every state in America is introducing higher, more rigorous standards for all students.
This past week, I attended an Orange Township public school board meeting in New Jersey in support of first-year teacher, Marylin Zuniga, who has been suspended from her teaching position at Forest Street Elementary School.
Last Thursday was Career Stars in the Media Center at Westland Middle School in Montgomery County. Spending so much time in corporate America, I was a tad nervous and wanted to do an especially good job as my daughter was in the audience.
There are three potentially important improvements and one significant backslide, but any shortcomings in this draft are fixable as this bill moves to the Senate floor. Sounds like a win for students, right? We're not so sure.
As exciting as all this was, where were the teachers in these conversations? Many of us felt that we were invited because we actively lead in our schools, communities, and countries, and we expected to have a similar role at ISTP. We felt stifled in the exchange. So, in true teacher form, we didn't give up.
Education has always been a bit of a black box. Before the uniform administration of state assessments, even teachers and schools who were doing truly astounding work were often only known to their students and their students' parents.
Hillary Clinton may need to school herself a bit more on \Leave No Child Behind,\ and the real story of the Common Core, if she wants to move teachers, students and parents off the sidelines. Those of us whose lives are being organized and sorted out for us have a different perspective on these tests.
Congress should amend the President's free tuition idea to create the civilian equivalent of a GI Bill for young adults who engage in 1-3 years of national service. That single change would turn the President's proposal from a college giveaway to an opportunity that serves both the individual and the country.
There's no silver bullet when it comes to helping all children achieve. Great public schools are our best shot. But until we have more leaders willing to look past ideology, listen to those closest to the classroom, and find common ground, we won't move forward.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for President. Let the questions begin. My question is, will she be good for public education?  Clinton's track record hasn't brought her into education issues very often. But there is one huge honking squealing flashing siren wrapped in a fluorescent red flag atop a high-powered blinking crimson light.
The way you interact with your fellow med student colleagues at work calls out your job description. It's not the content of what you say to each other as you cross paths in the hospital hallways that leaves your identity utterly exposed. Rather, it is the way your eyes transmit a complex but mutual signal of despair and competition that clearly says it all.
Teen parents who are able to finish high school have significantly better outcomes for themselves and their children than those that drop out.  That being the case, why do we offer no legal protection for teens based on their status as parents?
These changes are projected to save the government $60 billion over 10 years. While this may sound like a lot, it is a mere two percent of the $3.02 trillion in tax revenue the federal government collected in fiscal year 2014 alone.
On the one hundredth day of school, my son's teacher morphed each first grade child's photograph into an elderly individual with the facial lines of life experience and asked, \What do you want to be like when you are 100?\ My son wrote in response, \I want to be kind to kids.\
The pace of change is accelerating, and it's estimated that 70 percent of them will end up in jobs not yet invented. They will collaborate with people on multiple continents, struggling to solve problems we don't yet recognize.
In the Alexander-Murray reauthorization, assessments continue to eat up a notable portion of state education budgets. However, the language allows for states to seriously reduce testing time from that which is required of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) consortium tests.
The thing voters need to ask themselves is
The time is ripe for community colleges to start partnering up with young tech companies. I'm proud that our company is leading the industry in forging a new kind of relationship.
As an elementary school teacher for 17 years, I have been asked for the spelling of a word hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Every time I have been asked -- without exception -- I have given my student the spelling of the word. Happily.
While focusing on liberal arts is definitely important to teach our children, John Oliver's uncovering of Americans ill-informed comprehension of the Internet proves we need to place computer science at the same core level as math, science, history and reading.
We need more policymakers and parents pushing for a day when there isn't a rush to see the school lists of who will be teaching their child because every classroom is led by an excellent teacher.
School for me does not start in the classroom. My lessons begin the minute I leave my house. My commute now shapes my identity in ways I never imagined when I decided to attend high school in the heart of Chicago.
Through its unholy partnership with high stakes testing, the charter school movement has diverted our attention from the real issues confronting us and discouraged genuine innovation and reform. To paraphrase Einstein, \Charter schools are to experimentation as military music is to music.\
In case you need more reasons to oppose high-stakes Common Core tests, here are seven more reasons to opt-out.
Talent is fueled by a natural curiosity and love of learning that is either encouraged -- or squelched -- at a very early age.  By the time we reach peak earning years, we've spent thousands of hours mastering what we need.
Administrators need to ensure the product is economically feasible, teachers need to believe it promotes desired outcomes (increasingly aligned to Common Core and other standards), and students need to engage and not feel as if the technology is being forced upon them.
No doubt there are parents who feel that Success' approach to teaching and learning is not a good match for their child. No one should press these parents to send their children to such a school -- nor should they be forced to praise teaching methods with which they disagree.
Congress can ensure a better future for our kids by reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act with language that empowers schools to limit redundant benchmarking assessments, maintains annual standardized tests for third through eighth grade, and changes the stakes to offer more support to teachers serving students with the greatest needs.
As Mrs. Obama asserted, \if we all keep pushing forward, day after day, year after year, we will finally be able to give our kids the healthy futures they so richly deserve.\
Note to presidential candidates
A couple of recent stories highlight schools turning to online fundraising to provide students with everything from basic classroom supplies to long-distance field trips.
A homeschooling mom's video recently went viral and offers insight into the minds of people outraged at the idea of science museums. An audit implies a power relationship, and Fox had come to the Field Museum on a mission to put those scientists in their place.
We have to ask ourselves, now that answers to myriads of questions are a google search away, why would we measure student knowledge by an ability to regurgitate facts through multiple choice tests?
If this system of widespread and coordinated cheating has a positive outcome, it is to cast a bright light on the desperation of people trying to survive a system that punishes rather than supports struggling.
Spring is here, which means warm weather, antsy children, and another school vacation. When the fun and relaxing times end, returning to school can be quite overwhelming.
Trained extensively in the ENACT method, actors create a \safe container\ for students, many of whom are recruited for the program because of behavioral or truancy issues that are threatening to derail their academic careers.
School officials banned the wearing of the American-flag clothing on only one day of the school year. What day was that? Cinco de Mayo -- a day to celebrate Mexican heritage. School officials did not ban American-flag clothing on any other school day -- just one.
PDPs - Professional Development Plans (usually referred to as Professional Development Points by teachers) - are the primary means of giving teachers needed training during their careers.
When my children were much younger, I loved playing \Where's Waldo\ with them, trying to find the character in the distinctive hat amidst a confusing mass of other figures. They have grown, and now I play \Where's ESEA?\
For technology within the classroom to be effective, there must be noticeable benefits resulting from it and concerted studies are required to quantify the effects of technology on education.
Higher education must educate young people for jobs that do not yet exist, to solve problems that have yet to be identified. Upon graduation, they must be fully capable of adapting to change and reinventing themselves throughout their professional careers.
I've resisted this notion for a long time. The money, I liked to say, belongs to the taxpayers, who have used it to create a school system that serves the entire community by filling that community with well-educated adults. But hey-- maybe I've been wrong.
We've had enough of the lies -- being told that our students can't do the work, aren't proficient, and don't have what it takes to succeed in public schools.
Jill O'Malley, known to her readers as The Indignant Teacher, was a dedicated professional and mother of three from Boston. She shared many of the traits of the ten finalists for the Global Teacher Prize, an initiative intended to identify and celebrate what is working in education.
As educators and parents, we know that our kids will create the future. What skills should they be learning at school and at home to help them along the way? Ferry offers new ways of thinking about parenting and education and the values our children need to attain.
Despite having been raised by two teachers and working for an ed tech company, I knew that sending my oldest off to kindergarten this year would be an education for me.
While supporters of the corporate education reform agenda are denigrating parents, belittling students and targeting organize labor, one wonders who is keeping an eye out for protecting civil liberties and preserving American democracy.

Critical thinking is NOT starting with the conclusion that you want to reach and then constructing a bridge of arguments specifically designed to get you there, and yet this is perilously close to the kind of thinking a standardized test requires.
The initial strangeness you may encounter in reading Shakespeare is simply the play's way of telling you that you've entered another world, which is, after all, why you're reading his play in the first place.
Even with these improvements, one in five students is still not graduating on time, and the graduation rate remains 13.4 percentage points lower for black and Hispanic students than for white students.
Intelligence is of course an important part of the equation but what of creativity, of identifying and measuring divergent thinking, and fostering its development?
I would argue that attending a top college is not worthwhile because of the brand name of the institution, but rather because of the resources and opportunities for high level scholarship, access to top professors, alumni networking and motivated classmates.
Dear Fellow Parents, Did you know that in addition to your responsibilities of Chief Caregiver, Chief Cheerleader and Chief Taxi driver, Chief Advocate is high on the list? If you have a child with special needs, you know exactly where I'm going with this.
Please know that both legally and ethically, there are times when I want to say something or agree with you but cannot for a multitude of reasons, usually pertaining to the privacy of another student. I will miss your child for the rest of my life, even if your child was incredibly difficult and made my days long and exhausting.
It is ironic that the Women's Rights Movement which has opened up the doors of opportunity for talented women to have a greater choice of vocation has had a negative effect on recruiting the most gifted among them for careers in education. The future course of education must be to make the profession as attractive as it has become in Finland.
I work very well with others and have always easily got along with most people. Given my personality, I never thought being a waitress at a retirement community restaurant would pose such a difficult challenge.
Like most of us, I tend to assume however subconsciously that institutions I have passed through remain more or less preserved in time as in my own memory. I was surprised to see how much has changed since I graduated in 1988.
If we want to transform the K-12 education system to meet the needs and challenges of 21st-century citizenship and leadership, we need to ensure global learning is available for all.
\My advice to teachers is to democratize access in your institutions so that working families from urban and rural sectors can attend, and give the poor the same chance to prepare for higher education as the rich since the goal of education is to create an egalitarian society.\
Real education reform requires many voices, working on a variety of platforms, and a variety of issues. But the one voice that is consistently missing is the voice of educators. We can change that as a profession.
Now is the time for us to speak out, join together and reclaim the promise of America. That starts by educating our students about the impact of the civil rights movement, acting collectively to achieve a renewal of the Voting Rights Act and redoubling our efforts to ensure all children grow up in safe communities with high-quality neighborhood public schools.
Excellent schools make sure their students have access to the world's most advanced knowledge, they strengthen key skills such as creativity, critical thinking, collaboration and communication. But their main differentiator is that they also develop mindfulness, curiosity, courage, resilience and leadership.
Giving each child the earliest best possible shot at learning to read is an admirable and worthwhile goal, but demanding that each and every child meet a One Size Fits All standard is not, particularly when that standard has not taken into account the realities and varieties of early child development.
Parents and students talked about the dramatic changes in curriculum and a flood of test prep in classes and homework.  Some spoke about the massive expenditures for technology and testing materials, as hands-on instructional time declined.
When you became a parent, you were entrusted with a squishy little bundle of brains, possibilities, and aspirations--and you committed to giving your offspring everything at your disposal and more.
My identity and story are built on passions and habits. For example, something in my mind and body prevents me from falling asleep without reading the hard copy of the front page of The New York Times every night.

Congress has the opportunity to invest in our nation's most valuable resource -- our youth. We need to write to our legislators to remind them of the original intent of ESEA and the need to ensure that our students get a world-class education that allows them to become contributing members of society.
You might not have observed what is called \street art stickers\ before, but once you do, you'll start seeing them everywhere.
Reading is their sanctuary, their Holy of Holies, and when they are reading, they are on holy ground. Reading is their inspiration, their sacrament, their solace, their strength, and blessed are they who have discovered their bliss.
In the 11th and 12th grade, I had a student whose mother was in jail. He did not have much of a relationship with her. She had been incarcerated on and off for most of his life. One Friday afternoon, he told me she was going to be released. He had a car and planned to meet her after school across town.
With the digital revolution spreading its wings into all aspects of society, its inroads into academia are unavoidable. It is therefore essential that teachers be prepared both mentally and skill-wise in the use of technology in the classroom.
When I visited it was clear that a lot of things had spurred school improvement, but it had all started with a change in leadership. This is completely in line with all the best research -- school improvement almost always starts with a new principal.
LaVerne Evans Srinivasan, the new Vice President of Education Programs at Carnegie Corporation of New York, speaks with Deanna Lee, the Corporation's Chief Communications and Digital Strategies Officer, about finding inspiration and innovation.
Winston Churchill once defended democracy by calling it, \The worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\ Perhaps the same can be said for test-based accountability.
The Greek language is truly a gift to the development of European civilization, and its culture has influenced many people extending beyond the borders of Europe.  Although many educated Europeans carried with them the love for the ancient Greek language and culture upon settling in the New World, not much was known about the Greek culture as a whole.
Educators are still talking about a core curriculum, but nothing about its core. A few isolated voices call out for a \national conversation about race,\ but, for the most part, it goes unheeded.
We liked their innovative ideas so much, we decided to invite these talented 12 back each month to answer one big picture question related to 21st century education.
If you want to close achievement gaps between poor students of color and their wealthier white counterparts, you must reduce the high levels of socioeconomic isolation in urban communities.
By all means we need high expectations in our schools. But with the spotlight on income gaps, it's time to draw in the missing parts of the picture. Poverty is real. We need action at the statehouse, not just the schoolhouse, to enable educators to succeed in spite of it.
We took our son to the bookstore constantly in the first four years of his life. What happened next was astounding.
If people are afraid -- and it is fear that underlies the refusal to vaccinate -- they don't need to be badgered or sneered at, they need to be reassured. And that reassurance comes best from someone they trust. If not Roald Dahl, perhaps an older person who might remember what it was like before vaccines.

To spend more time with my two little girls and to learn something new together, I enrolled us in a Taekwondo dojang.
Given those kinds of positive results for Wisconsin, one could say that Walker has been rather pro-education. So, why has he suddenly decided to go on the offensive against education?
It is my strong belief that if we, as an educational community, are to succeed in taking full advantage of our ever-evolving \21st century\ tools, we first need to commit ourselves to sharpening our understanding and usage of some \20th century\ (or older) educational staples.
It has never been easier to learn. Formal and informal learning options abound. The opportunity set has never been greater. But, as opportunities and options explode, families are faced with unprecedented amounts of decisions related to education.
In honor of Black History Month last week at the Apollo, director and producer Martin Shore and legendary artists celebrated the launch of an educational mission to empower and educate students.
All paths lead to the mountaintop, and every teacher of Shakespeare has his or her way of teaching his plays.  This is the first in a series of articles that explore one teacher's suggestions to high-school students for reading his plays. These articles are addressed to students, but teachers also may find them of interest, as may the general reader.
A recent article notes that the TFA program is \suddenly having recruitment problems.\ The article reveals that applications are down 10 percent, yet the demand for recruits from the program \is extremely high,\ according to the co-chief executive of Teach for America.
Technology has become further integrated into the daily operations of most Australian schools.\nThe entire teacher workforce can now collaborate nationally on innovations in practice that address the problems they encounter in implementing a new curriculum.

A high-quality public education can unlock our children's potential. It can bring communities together. It can ensure a top-notch workforce for our economy and an engaged citizenry for our democracy. We have an opportunity with the ESEA reauthorization to help reclaim the promise of public education.
Who is teaching kids problem-solving, or entrepreneurism, or how to collaborate and appreciate diversity? Tests don't really assess that.
If we're going to wring our hands over whether today's kids are losing creativity, though, it only takes seeing the smiles and obvious pride on \MasterChef Junior\ participants' faces to suggest that it's worth the attempt.
At this time of protest over systems of power, oppression, racism, and police brutality, Imagining America
We Americans believe in equality; therefore we believe each of us has a unique potential waiting to be realized. But only some of us excel in academics, just as some of us excel in athletics, performing arts, salesmanship and so on.
The care we give to buying a vacuum cleaner is absent when we consider the test scores released to the news media by the states and local school districts. And, from those test scores the news media, politicians, and the general public reach simplistic conclusions about the effectiveness of public education.
Most innovations fail. And like NPR Planet Money's Adam Davidson explains, \life span of innovations has never shorter, meaning that failure happens more quickly.\ So it is not too soon to start to contemplate of the obituaries of the contemporary school reform movement.
Let's make an even greater investment in the Pell Grant program. And let's eradicate labor market inequalities that reward white high school dropouts with greater access to jobs than black graduates with a community college degree.
In January of 2013, I had no sooner finished speaking to a group of independent school leaders about how online and blended learning would impact their schools in the future, when one of the audience members rushed up to tell me why I was wrong.
To learn more about the the recent report, \Reading Instruction in Kindergarten

A number of labels that originally signified progressive ideas continue to be (mis)appropriated, their radical potential drained away, with the result that they're now invoked by supporters of \bunch o' facts\ teaching or a corporate-styled, standards-and-testing model of school reform.
Tulsa's choice is doubly perplexing at a time when the new chair of the Senate Education Committee, Lamar Alexander, is crafting compromises that will undo the policies that coerced states into adopting value-added evaluations, and pulling the plug on the failed SIG that Gist promoted.
The College Board -- yes, the same folks behind the dreaded SAT exam all college-bound high school students must take with a No. 2 pencil -- estimates the average costs of tuition and fees for a private college in 2013-14 topped $30,000.
In a town like Chicago, \choice\ isn't a right, but a privilege based on income, class, and skin color.
In the Inland Empire sprawling east of Los Angeles, the promise of the American-California Dream can seem as remote as the Pacific and the Sierras.
America's colleges and universities would do well to examine what RIT and other leaders in career services are doing right, because many, if not most, are getting it wrong.
The California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (CCSESA) has held several arts training events based on a groundbreaking program called \Creativity at the Core\ in advance of the broader vision.
I'm blessed and privileged to be a teacher. The longer I do it, the more I appreciate it. But Andrew Cuomo has not the remotest notion of why that is.
As high-stakes testing becomes even more unpopular, we can also anticipate more of his efforts to pretend that it isn't punitive. But the use of test scores to punish is, by definition, the use of tests to punish.
Public charter schools have taken firm root in Washington, DC. This year, for the first time since charter schools were introduced to the District 18 years ago, more public schools in the city are run by charters than by DC Public Schools (DCPS).
It was the call to action heard 'round the Internet
While it would be such a relief for schools if helping students become \good\ was as simple as teaching them emotional skills, a recent study suggests that there's a lot more to acting morally than knowing how to manage your emotions.
According to a 2014 paper by the Australian psychology professor Arthur E. Poropat, research has shown that \conscientiousness\ and \openness\ (i.e. creativity and curiosity) are more important to student success than intelligence.
Should schools teach personality or character? This is the question posed in a recent New York Times op-ed by Anna North. When educators focus on personality or character, you get debates about whether it is the role of schools to try to imbue character or personality.
The President has introduced only the grand idea of providing tuition-free education for all students attending community colleges, an idea which, at first glance, seems to have great merit.  But at this point we know very few details.
Boats are like movie cameras and can grow into films or stories themselves. When you think a boat's life is over -- dead, think again; its ending grows into a new beginning. Boats can have many lives, as long as their captain has a dream and a good work ethic.
Do our young people know about our own nation's history, particularly how our society has responded to marginalized groups? This question has been coming up consistently for me in recent months.
There is a gap--no, a chasm--between what scholars find to be at the root of achievement gaps and what we must do to narrow them, and the agendas that many policymakers continue to push.
Investments in education technology are at an all-time high, but school curricula have become increasingly structured and standardized, at the expense of playtime and the arts.
While research evidence does not support current pro-choice and high stakes accountability reforms, their ideological appeal seems widespread. Perhaps we can learn from a country in which these neoliberal policies were imposed before they became prominent in the U.S.
Something about our fast-paced, super consumerist society seems to have robbed the teaching vocation the respect it deserves, disposing that once concrete and tender human relationship to a matter of mere transaction.
How did they do it? How did an island nation of five million people become one of the elite education systems on the planet? What is their secret, their special formula? What is the Singapore story?

We need to take a serious look at our Pre-K and Kindergarten programs before we have a generation of students so far behind they will never catch up.
McLay's words were intended mainly for the officers under his command. But they could just as well have been addressed to educators in our nation's schools.
The revolution we still need builds on the values of equity, democracy and community responsibility that drove these advances. The revolution we still need seeks even broader racial, social and economic justice.
Don't let the language of health care get you down!  Find out what's behind the words. Their roots speak directly to you about how you think about your body -- while putting a smile on your face.
Why aren't more students motivated and why haven't we figured out how to get them motivated? The problem with motivation is not necessarily an issue with students or even with teachers as some might think.
We are well aware of the critiques of higher education, and with the cost of college rising faster than health care, it should come as no surprise parents and taxpayers feel they are not getting their money's worth.
The year was 1965. It was a warm fall day, and I was driving Paul Goodman, the noted thinker and prominent social theorist to his hotel.  He was to be a guest speaker at a program I had created for area high school students to dialogue with prominent writers, artists, and politicians.
Not only do students not read much, some actually express an active hostility towards reading. But being able to read is half the benefit of being human.  As far as I am concerned, if I couldn't read, I'd just as soon be running around the Serengeti with the hyenas and wildebeest.
Bank of America recently teamed up with USA Today to gain deeper insights on millennials' financial habits and attitudes about money.
Teaching is an art form all of its own. It's not easy to teach. Not only because teachers are never paid enough in our culture (or others), but because it takes patience and understanding and preparation and methodology.
Of course, the ideas of different members of the University community will often and quite naturally conflict. But it is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.
US educational technology companies raised a total of $1.36 billion in 2014, according to a recent report. But very little of that technology is likely to end up in the K-12 classroom as part of the teaching-learning process that education is supposed to be about. Why is this, should we worry, and can we do anything to change it?
This semester I taught two college composition classes at a community college. I started with 23 students in one class and 24 students in the other. Halfway into the semester, 7 students out of 47 just stopped coming to class. But that's just the data I collected. Here is what I learned...
Unless lawmakers can be made to understand the critical role these and other educational professionals play in contributing to schools in which we can all be confident and proud, then many of these positions will remain in jeopardy to the detriment of the students and communities they serve.
These are questions that go to the heart of what it means to be human in this or in any century. The Bible keeps these questions alive, not so much by the answers it gives as by the many questions it provokes in the reader, questions which are rarely if ever raised in our modern world.
Everybody was blogging in 2014, and especially teachers.  We asked The Global Search for Education editorial team and our blogging advisors to submit their favorite teacher blogs and blog posts from around the world.
Given the nature and sheer number of challenges, his administration has done a great deal to foster positive change and progress. In a bid to build upon his already stellar record on education Obama implemented a number of education reform initiatives in 2014.
2014 was a good year for P-20 education and we experienced some great wins and made huge strides. Let's look back at just a few of these accomplishments.
The goal of school isn't to do well on a test. Doing school should never be for the purpose of more school. The goal of school is to create moral citizens that will fall in love with learning.
The late '60s and '70s featured a blossoming of educational reform and a progressive vision. Most of these efforts, however, were not taken seriously and were prematurely aborted -- succeeded by a wave of counter-reaction. They have also been banished from recent memory.
In December, I continued my conversations with world leaders on the frontiers of education reform. These leaders all share a commitment to transforming education at the ground level, so that the poorest and most disadvantaged schools can become sites for development.
By the sheer nature of how much time students spend in school, educators are the main people who can assist parents with that goal. More opportunities to exercise and have a healthy diet at school will be the most effective methods for eliminating obesity as we know it.

Writing more, being more fully present, watching for opportunities to learn, and to teach. This first blog post at this new site is a first step. This seems like enough for one birthday. But there is so much more.
Aphorisms are an excellent way of encouraging critical and creative responses when teaching about the Bible. These quotations offer thoughtful reflections by world authors on a broad range of religious questions.
In today's educational landscape there are a lot of players vying for influence over the future of America's P-20 educational system. Of these players, none have been as influential as the \Billionaire Boys Club.\
We also are doing a far better job at staffing our schools with the special education personnel that can oversee the progress of these students and offer appropriate advice and support for teachers and parents.

Twitter and other social media tools aren't always celebrated as meaningful message delivery tools, but Twitter is one of my best technological friends.

Let 2014 slip away, with that noble but unattained goal. In 2015, let us use experience and research to find a better way to improve the schools. Students, educators, parents, and the country as a whole deserve better.

In the context of the \Mindfulness Revolution\, mindfulness has been introduced to many college and university campuses as an element of classroom activities, student clubs, and offerings from wellness centers.
Change takes time. But what sets our nation apart is that, even in our darkest hours, we strive to make things better. During this week's winter solstice, we celebrate the holiday season with light as a symbol of hope.
In 2003, the provincial government of Ontario, Canada initiated a focus on educational improvement as one of its key strategies for the future success of its people and its economy. Since then, the entire system has dramatically improved.
'Tis the season for colder weather, family get-togethers, and -- let's not forget -- the highest credit-card spending Americans will undertake over the course of the year.
There are things you can do right now, both to increase your chances of acceptance at your top choice school, and to strengthen your regular decision applications.
Finish high school, go to college, graduate four or five years later and go to work--only it doesn't work that way very often for Millennials. High rates of young adult unemployment, expensive degrees, and challenging life circumstances are causing many young people to rethink college.
The winds of education change were gusty in 2014
And, bottom line, a large cohort of Mandarin speakers will contribute to our national security, helping guide U.S.-Chinese relations away from the confrontational and toward the cooperative.
Include students in decision-making. Encourage them to question food production and supply systems, and to envision solutions. Challenge them -- and just as importantly, invite them to challenge you -- to think in new and forward-looking ways.
As I listened to the president speak, it struck me just how important this day was for our children. This will be a day I look back to as a pivotal moment for early education.
While all good schools work to meet the needs of every child, it can seem as if demanding \squeaky-wheel\ parents get more attention than those who quietly try to follow school protocol. Yet how much of our protocol is explicit? Who helps parents learn what's appropriate?
The culmination of the schooling process from educational comics.
We were just able to pull high level metrics such as increased interest in STEM, overall reach, contact hours etc. They are a step forward, but there is so much more data that we can gather to draw a more nuanced picture that will be helpful for the field.
I currently teach Math. But I don't have a single student who likes their English class, and it makes me wonder why. I loved it because I happened to be an obnoxious little linguaphile. The way English classes are (often) run would surely turn off any kid who isn't one.
Our quick review of the testing mania continues.
MakeSchool, which was originally named MakeGamesWithUs, was born after Ashu Desai and Jeremy Rossmann decided that they needed to fix the educational gap in CS education.


Louisiana State Superintendent John White insists that Louisiana students in grades 3 through 8 will take the Partnership for Assessment of College and Careers (PARCC) assessments in the spring of 2015.


Instead of changing an admissions policy that rewards hard work and preparation to a process that is subjective and that could be manipulated, how about putting systems in place to get kids ready? Provide test prep to those who don't have access. Share information with families early.
How do we fulfill our responsibility to this generation of children so that they can realize sooner than I did that our systems are broken and that it is everyone's responsibility to fix them?
Yet scientists are discovering that what society says about men's (and boys') social and emotional abilities is simply not true, and that cultivating their natural capacity for emotional attunement and relationships is critical to their overall well-being. But we need to start when they're young.
When I was young, all aspects of the school day were learning experiences.  Mistakes happened and I learned right from wrong, success from failure. Parents regularly are forgetting this simple process of the educational day.
OK. Today, I want to talk to you about lying to yourself. We all do it. And a lot of us lie to ourselves because without realizing it, we can't face the truth, and it's easier to craft a story, to craft a lie.
\What's your job?\ I ask my third grade students.  \To learn!\ they exclaim enthusiastically.  \And what's my job?\ I follow up.  \To teach us!\ they reply, matter-of-factly.
We have come far in our quest for education. The journey of knowledge and exploration is quite fascinating and deeply speaks about the interconnectedness and the interdependence of the world.
In November, I continued my conversations with world leaders on the frontiers of education reform. Each of this month's leaders dealt with situations that seemed unmanageable
Business school may be the right decision for any one individual, but I find it increasingly hard to see why the real leaders of the future will continue to choose this path. An MBA is a form of insurance; a highly-conservative move to hedge against risk.
This is why we have so much to grateful for in our modern world.  Because so many asked \Why,\ so many were willing to make sacrifices because they found and understood the answers.
Political economist Gordon Lafer offers some \Bleak Friday\ predictions about the corporate agenda for public education.
They also inspire legions of future non-scientists -- bankers and writers and ballerinas -- to embrace the joy of discovery, to grasp how science works and understand how to ask critical questions and evaluate evidence.
This is the sixth column from that second book. Enjoy! Feel free to share your thoughts. Feedback and Pushback are encouraged.
Everybody should know these stories because they're so much a part of our culture. You have to know what they're about to be culturally literate, and you have to admit that you really can understand why people think and behave as they do from what we've been reading and discussing for the past several weeks.
Pakistan is not only looking up, with more students completing education programs, but is also showing its own leadership, and thus growing independently from external aid.

The K-12 classroom is continually evolving in order to adapt to the times. It's important that teachers keep up-to-date with the latest helpful technology for their students and that parents understand the ramifications of that technology, too.
The bottom line is that New Jersey charters do not serve the same population as the districts that house them. Specifically, they serve a smaller percentage of poor students and students with extra learning challenges.
The students who make up the poverty and homeless statistics that some suburbanites look at dispassionately, shaking their heads while proclaiming, \Not in America!\ -- these kids want to succeed.
Well, it's official. With Daylight Savings Time behind us and the Winter Solstice approaching, the days are starting to feel shorter. Much shorter.
As a blended learning pioneer and enthusiast, I'm here to tell you technology, on its own, is no cure. More and more, blended learning has become a misused buzzword in education circles.
How do you tell a promising student with the heart and mind to be a fantastic teacher that she can't afford to join us in the world's best profession?
On top of the shear panic unleashed by the spread of the Ebola virus from West Africa, an astonishing amount of ignorance has reared its ugly head. As some have commented, this ignorance may be more dangerous to millions of people than the actual virus.
Who doesn't want the education and care for young children to be high quality? Parents look for it, advocates fight for it, policy makers debate it. But just what is it?
Policymakers, business, labor and community can come together to make CTE a thriving component of our 21st-century education system -- and with it, an engine that helps more young people have access to good jobs and the American dream.
Are smaller class sizes the key to breathing new life into today's public schools, or a misguided effort to solve the problems of a dying era? I am surprised to say I have come to believe it's the latter.
Gone are the days of President Reagan's ketchup as a vegetable. And it is about time the feds try to do something to combat childhood obesity and promote healthy eating habits. Problem is, a lot of students aren't eating any of it.
The secret to the success of the Writing Retreat, I believe, was that we created a place for our writers to work alone, together.

We teachers find ourselves under the jurisdiction of the state education department.  Do I think these guys are evil people?  No, I do not.  I just think that they are not as highly qualified as the teachers when it comes to reaching and teaching kids.
The more we ask of children, the more they can do; the higher the standards we set for those who teach children, the farther they will reach.
Just as much as students need concrete academic help, they need us to notice their drive and their struggle. We can do this by making sure that we acknowledge the work they're putting into the class, whether it's showing up in their grades or not.

As a society, I wish we would do more to celebrate the boring stuff. The boring stuff is important. Math is important. History is important. English is important.
The Obama White House has proposed that high-quality pre-school be extended to every child in America and has been convening meetings around the country with a broad group of stakeholders dedicated to his early learning agenda.
Just the opposite is true. Flip the question and consider the many ways grades fail the learning process. Grades tend to inhibit curiosity by encouraging students to do only what is required to earn an A.
While report card day is a moment of truth for students, when is the time for states to pony up accurate information about how they're doing to parents? The answer in too many states is not often enough.
While most mentoring organizations share these learning environment characteristics, we have profiled at least one for each to provide an example of how this framework is being currently practiced in the field.
We know that early education creates a foundation. We know exposure to words, language and literacy provides a ladder to boost children with extra challenges to the starting line in kindergarten.
Unless we rethink administrative and teacher tenure, it will be difficult to accurately measure teacher or school accountability. Here are some suggestions for a better way forward.
There is a solid base of evidence that we can draw on to support educational practices that can teach students to get along, to accept and even embrace those who are different to them.
I slide out of bed around 5:25 a.m., the sun still preparing for a long day in the sky. It's pitch-black, except for the faint light at the end of the corridor, which leads upstairs to Nana's house. This illumination is my sunrise every morning. As my foot touches the cold tiled floor, I arrive at my early morning sanctuary.
There was a second reason why the Founders feared that bringing religion into politics would have a divisive effect on our young nation -- the rise of political and religious opportunists, who would inflame political issues to further themselves.
Everything -- everything -- tells us that if our goal really is to put a great teacher in every classroom, reformsters, educational thought leaders, and rich unelected amateurs who somehow get to set education policy are going about it exactly backwards. The attacks on tenure are literally the exact opposite of what is needed.
We need to make teachers feel respected and trusted. Articles like the recent Time Magazine cover story do just the opposite. It is an attack on the profession as a whole and thus makes all teachers defensive, which does not lead to the kind of education we want in our schools.
A common thread connects these thought leaders, which is a commitment to using innovative, hands-on methods to solve the problems of inadequate education programs.
Many people associate learning disabilities with low intelligence, laziness, lack of success, and not being able to learn. Sadly, the people who make these associations include the very children and adults that have been diagnosed with a learning disability.
As schools are starting to take seriously the concept of virtual class days during those blizzards and other days off of school, I believe they will need a more modern version of accountability.
Missoula County Montana isn't just teaching every kid in the school department the truth about native populations, their culture and their tragic history. It's keeping track of each and every tribe represented in the classroom.
California's momentum on early learning was in the spotlight this week, when the White House came to town for \Children
We probably all have memories of our favorite teachers, the ones who inspired us and still make us smile years later. And then there are the ones who are like Grendel at the banqueting hall in Beowulf, casting a long shadow.
Education today clearly ranks as a top priority for Saudi Arabia. Early childhood education has also received government support and mainstream attention in recent years, due in part to two Saudi visionaries. Ilham Al-Dakheel and Samia Kazi have been a powerful force in helping to gain recognition of the importance of early education.
Understanding the importance of bystander intervention and how to make a positive impact using it is a skill set that is needed in every school. These alleged incidents are proof that a conversation and education about bystander intervention is needed in every school and every home in our country.
Colleges and universities need to take the lead on this, and while there are some government restrictions on what we can do, there are some relatively simple things we can do that can make a real difference. The Responsible Borrowing Initiative at WGU is a case in point.

There is no question of the cancerous effects of groups like PennCAN and the Commonwealth Foundation. It may be years before we know the full range of the damage they have inflicted on our children and schools or how long it will take to repair that damage. One thing, however, is clear
With a boost from Hillary Clinton last weekend in San Diego, the American Academy of Pediatricians launched the next phase of its campaign to help close the \word gap\ between children in high- and low-income families.
In the middle 90's, \value\ was the hot new word and every business was trying to improve its value equation -- which we operationally define as \outcomes divided by cost.\
The tragedy is that people no longer know how to distinguish solid reporting from speculation, from regurgitation or, frankly, from just plain drivel.
We have yet another example of the problems introduced by \charter churn\
Performance incentives for public service always -- always -- involve substituting the values of the few for the values of everybody. Imagine if, for instance, we paid fire fighters on sliding scale, based on how many of which type fires they put out at a certain speed.
As an educational app reviewer with a four-year-old who was born a month before the debut of the iPad, I can verify that Learn with Homer is among the best apps available that teaches foundational reading.
We should stop obsessing about test scores and start obsessing about the health and well-being of children and their families. The gains would be far more valuable than a few points on a standardized test.
We will know that we have succeeded when the headlines about non-verbal children achieving literacy stop because it is no longer news and all children on the spectrum have mastered this vital skill.
I have seen schools throughout the country where the excitement of learning is palpable and students utilize technology and internet access as an integral component in their daily learning.
A simple way for teachers to bring mindfulness to the act of teaching is to recite a mantra -- a short phrase that helps us on those days when our classroom feels more like Lord of the Flies than Dead Poets Society.
Even programs with the best intentions sometimes have difficulty attracting girls to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). Here are some tips and tricks for balancing the gender gap for your event:
A specter is haunting America - the privatization of its public schools, and Big Money has entered into an unholy alliance to aid and abet it. Multi-billionaire philanthropists and others are making common cause to hasten the destruction of public schools.
STEM is indeed critical for American economic competitiveness and progress. So naturally you'd expect that STEM subjects would be among the best researched of all, right?
Neshaminy High School officials have been locked for a year now in an uproariously abhorrent battle royale of their own making with the school's student newspaper. Why? Because staffers decided they would no longer print the name of the school's mascot.
Public policy for public education is destroying it. Wholesale. That's the only conclusion I can draw from screening \Rise Above the Mark,\ a new documentary designed to spark a much-needed conversation about what is happening to public education.
We need to find out how to prevent every school shooting, but focusing on the overwhelming male incidence of these tragic events may be helpful.
You can't just take your kid on a vacation to Spain and consider your work done, nor can you sign up for a language course during sophomore year of college and check \global mindset\ off your to-do list. Developing a global mindset should begin before birth and continue for a lifetime.
We must listen to all students, regardless of what they look like, their ethnicity, or their sociocultural backgrounds. They remind us of why we are lifelong learners. Meaningful dissent can be the foundation for meaningful change. If we want problem solvers in our society, then we must let all students consider (openly) when things are and are not working.
Sexism, gender-based double standards, and male entitlement are so normalized that girls think sexual assault and violence are just a \part of life\ that they have to live with.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is seriously f***ed up.
The \political lens\ reminds us that certain claims deserve a larger dose of skepticism than others. The agendas behind a movement are especially important to consider when we lack in-depth knowledge of a particular issue.
Marc Tucker, president and chief executive of the National Center on Education and the Economy, recently unveiled a proposed accountability plan for public schools that includes significantly reducing the number of tests students take, and building extensive professional development time for teachers into every school day.
Common Core has a brand problem. Two separate national surveys demonstrate rapidly declining support for the Common Core State Standards initiative.
What if the negligent teachers described in the Vergara were granted tenure at 26 like me? How many children did they let down, how many families did they disappoint, how many futures did they stymie, how many lives did they hurt? What if they were my children's teachers?
This month has been declared New Conversation Month by reformsters. Teachers are being offered (in vaguely non-specific ways) some sort of seats at various tables. Unfortunately, this largesse underlines just how much teachers have not been included in conversations about public education.
Conservative politicians across the country have spent much of the past few years attempting to remake public education in their image. This idea of presenting the U.S. as infallible has long been a conservative talking point but the reality is that patriotism is just conservative code for political correctness.
Research clearly demonstrates that integrating social-emotional learning (SEL) into the classroom is good for both students and the adults who work with them. But there's a story that the research hasn't captured -- the one of powerful transformation.
We must continue to raise quality in order to provide children with the kind of early experiences that are proven to boost high school graduation, increase college enrollment and completion, reduce crime and prepare a skilled workforce for the 21st century.
My Brother's Keeper is not simply an effort to improve the condition for racial and ethnic minority communities, it is an endeavor of considerable national consequence with a capacity to improve all communities, for all of us.
This new way of looking at ELL students, as untapped assets rather than a drain on resources, may help us reform a system in desperate need of new solutions.
Instead of starving our schools of critical funding and pushing market-based, test-driven policies that ultimately fail our kids, we should be relying on evidence and input from those closest to the classroom to find solutions that work.
Investment in technology is on the increase. Some continue to claim it hurts the classroom. Others are more convinced it is transforming the classroom in a positive way. However, most now believe the goal must be about transforming the learning process.
The truth is that the teachers who are working with your children come with a wealth of experience. In addition, kid's personalities and true characters tend to come out in these interviews.
A school's first priority should be to teach students to think for themselves. Everything else is an educational frill!
This year, for the first time, American high school students show a greater overall appreciation for the First Amendment than do adults.
Kids lose their childhoods to appease the college admissions Gods (and their parents), endure record rates of depression and anxiety, and arrive on campus stripped of curiosity or self-knowledge. They excel at following orders, hence they are \excellent sheep.\
I felt intensely grateful that I'd had a writing mentor in college who had modeled dedicated, patient, relaxed, non-bullying work with students. Not changing what your students write but doing your best to bring it into fuller bloom.  That's not easy.
When so called \reformers\ like Campbell Brown try to make the case that tenure extends teachers an unfair guarantee of employment unlike other public servants, she is more than stretching the truth.
Though the rating system due out in the fall is widely viewed as a preliminary effort, onlookers worry its accountability provisions lack the data to evaluate schools accurately.
Unfortunately, it is too late for Jenny. I hope it's not too late for someone else who happens to read this letter. I don't want to lose another child, friend, family member or stranger to the pain of hopelessness.
To help students interested in a career in game design get started, the Entertainment Software Association releases a state-by-state list of video game programs in higher education.
California has long been a leader in education. It's time for its standards to catch up to its reputation.
I may not be skilled enough to set a broken leg or brave enough carry a person from a burning building, but I, like my colleagues, can work to inspire a teenager to believe in his own potential, to see that her future depends on hard work and perseverance, to teach them the math they will need in high school and beyond.

The lack of motivation to learn often results in low performance, poor self-esteem and disruptive behavior. As self-image decreases, the desire to constructively contribute to society declines creating a downward spiral.
It's no surprise that too many students start each school year without the supplies they need, or walk into classrooms that don't have the resources required for a productive year.
RBI was launched in 2008 by a unique collaboration of artists, art and cultural organizations, school districts, governments, businesses and donors who believed in the concept of \arts integration.\
The Education in America series for HuffPost Live discusses what truly defines an amazing teacher and what challenges teachers are facing in the present-day.

Recruiting 250,000 Americans into full-time service, with a majority laboring in schools, can be the heart of a massively scaled \second shift\ in education and can in turn recruit, train and support citizen change makers.
The lack of women and minorities in philosophy may be an anomaly in the academy, especially among the humanities, but it is not an accident.
If the Walton family is truly interested in helping every child achieve a high-quality education, they could begin by committing to pay their own workers a decent wage instead of spending their billions to wipe out our nation's public school system.
The controversy surrounding the use of physical restraints and seclusion rooms in schools has exploded and resonated across the country from Hawaii to Massachusetts.
Each time I gathered materials to teach these 'controversial' units, there was always a fleeting voice in my head that questioned if these were topics my sophomores and juniors could handle, but within minutes I pushed those thoughts to the side and decided that for the benefit of my students.
Given that not much got accomplished in Newark I'm a touch puzzled that Mark Zuckerberg is now doubling down and giving $120 million to Bay Area schools.

How do you they lead their people well and subsequently bring about change on a global scale?  Andy Hargreaves, Alan Boyle and Alma Harris conducted an extensive seven-year global research study that focused on fifteen high-performing organizations in business, sports and education to find out the answers to these questions.
If we think about computers not as instruments for solitary learning, but as collaborative tools that enable students to interact with others with whom they otherwise wouldn't have had the opportunity to connect, we stretch education in ways that have never been seen.
Every year, thousands of people across America embark on an incredible journey. They are a variety of people -- from young to old, recent college graduates to retirees, lawyers to medical professionals from all backgrounds and from states across the country.
It is time to be going back to school with more than brand new backpacks filled with school supplies.  Here's to the 2014-15 school year kick-off with vigilant attention to EVERY aspect of our children's health and development!
One way to reverse the trend of the corporatization of our schools, the \yield returns\ mentality, is to re-imagine a new future in the \subversive\ classroom.
The future of learning should be such that it gives greater flexibility to the learner, confidence that the self can learn anything, basic idea clarity on complex thoughts and processes and awareness about the world at large and tolerance.
I found three of Duncan's statements particularly ironic. He wrote about his continuing commitment to a \spirit of flexibility,\ flexibility that is completely lacking in Race to the Top mandates.

In the time remaining for his administration, Secretary Duncan can still make his place in history by rebalancing the educational reform initiatives in favor of providing more constructive supports for teachers.
Teaching writing has been a challenge for teachers for years.   That is one of the reasons why many adults are poor writers; they did not get the training they needed in elementary school and high school.
The best thank you we could give Senator Jeffords would be to continue working until we reach the day when every child has access to a high-quality after school program.
Kids are expelled for drugs or carrying knives. They are given detention when they swear or wear the wrong shoes. So why is racist bullying not taken as seriously? Why do many teachers close their eyes to name calling and \small\ scuffles?
The pressure to have high-performing students is the bane of every teacher's existence and research shows that too much time off from the school routine can actually undo the hard work teachers put in to their students.
We have always had plenty of soul-killing, drill and kill instruction. In the past, however, it was seen as education malpractice. Now, it is imposed in the name of \reform.\
What do low-income students get out of this? A chance to take an AP test. Not, mind you, more resources to get ready for it, nor do they get help with actually going to a college after taking the test (which may or may not give them any help once they get in).

When it comes to education, there seems to be a competing theory that differences should be dismissed in favor of finding a standardized way to teach all K-12 students.
The question, in the end, is not whether or not MOOCs are effective teaching tools, but whether or not they can contribute to learning. While this may seem like a minor distinction, it places the responsibility on the learner and the learning context, not on the MOOC.
I felt like I was at a funeral, not in English, my favorite subject.  Laughing faces turned into frowns. It took forever for her to reach me, returning a 72 on a piece about Who's Afraid of Post Blackness? This grade threw me as hard as my horse Braun had thrown me out of my tack.
The bureaucrats charged with implementing the Common Core dodge the flak from right and left, pointing out that the Common Core is a set of common standards, not a prescribed curriculum.   This defense, while limitedly accurate, is irrelevant. The problem with the Common Core is that it drives bad education.
When I finally realized that the temporary insanity I was experiencing in my clients was actually full out anxiety, I took a look at all the habits, actions and tools I used as a child and even now as a parent coach and mother, to tame the Back-to-School Freak Out.
So you say you'd like a cheerful education story for a change. Fine. Let's talk about Dolly Parton. Really.
With the start of the school year just around the corner, now is an excellent time for all of us to renew our commitment to ensuring all children succeed. So what should be at the top of to-do lists as children head back to school?

Summing up the problem
There isn't anything in recent educational history that has caused more of a stir than the implementation of national Common Core standards in most states. It seems that everyone from politicians to parents has an opinion.
Jiang Xueqin believes that the very best American institutions of learning have \a culture and tradition of openness, diversity, and risk-taking that China must emulate if China is to progress as a society and as a culture.\
Often times what is failed to mention about mentorship is that it is difficult to develop that relationship.  That relationship is so difficult to develop because it can be seen as a one-way street.

We have heard again and again that we are losing \the global competition\ to nations like South Korea where students and parents take tests very seriously. But are test scores worth it?
It's estimated that in the next decade the number of computer science jobs in the U.S. will outnumber qualified people by 1 million. That's 1 million jobs for the taking that Americans will miss out on because of inadequate skill sets.
Although it is not the silver bullet that many believed it would be, Race to the Top is definitely a step in the right direction when it comes to education policy reform.

Public education, in my opinion, is one of the greatest gifts to our youth -- but only if this gift is given to them with their unique emotional, mental, and developmental needs in mind.
Having written curricula and lesson plans geared to the high school level Common Core Standards, I just don't see what all the hub bub's about.
These keys to developing \personal intelligence\ are experienced while \masterfully\ listening to another person. The masterful listener is quiet inside, totally receptive and connects with their heart to the person who is speaking.
Alberto was a remarkable human being who will be missed by all who embraced his commitment to change the world.
Whether you agree or disagree with the court ruling, we all have an opportunity to look beyond the past or the present and to shape the future policies that will elevate our profession and the kind of education we offer our students.
The question on everyone's lips was \How did you get Michelle Obama to visit your program?\ The answer is simple
New Zealand has one of the most devolved school systems in the Western world.  If, for example, a school in New Zealand is failing, the final say on all things resides with the school community.
As the stakes rise regarding the necessity of a high school diploma for lifelong success, so do the standards to earn one. High school graduates today must know more than the generations that came before them.


It's well past time for President Hollande to issue a strong response to this incident and others like it. If he does not, it will send a clear message that tolerating or even spreading hatred is acceptable in France.
It is time for education to include the skills which for too long have been left to random chance. The potential of heart intelligence deserves our attention and integration into our ideas about what is education.
Is this an era of disruption? There can be little doubt that the constant barrage of infotainment influences how we perceive personal and societal circumstances. Do we have time to reflect on what we are learning from our families, our colleagues, our students and our research?
There should have been a conversation about what it means to educate all parts of a child, from the head to the heart, to the physical body.  What can we do to start helping all children to develop ALL parts of themselves?
You know when you fall in love, that feeling that you want to tell everyone you know about it? That's me right now. I'm in love with an eReader.
Following the successful mobile gaming application business model, ed-tech companies are starting to offer free services with paid upcharges. Consider Candy Crush Saga a way of doing business.
Why would 3,500 people go to sun- and fun-filled Los Angeles and opt to spend the bulk of their time inside a cavernous convention hall? To be heard.
Ah! The wonderful sound of clanging medals, young voices cheering, and the slapping of high fives -- it's the sound of students being rewarded for collaborating and utilizing their STEM skills. This sound does not come without a price -- it is the sound that can come after as many successes as failures.
I don't personally think video games will re-define creativity, but I do believe they can offer a whole new range of opportunities for people, especially those who might be intimidated or unengaged by more traditional pathways, to enjoy the experience of creative and musical expression.
A new report suggests that when it comes to summer enrichment programs, the opportunities that might help slow that academic slide for struggling students are out of reach for many families.
Both national teachers' unions have recently given voice to a popular teacher daydream -- the departure of Arne Duncan from the U.S. Department of Education. But the fantasy of having Duncan go away and be replaced by someone more suitable for the job is a fantasy.
The problem isn't drought, it's a flood. Yet, you know it takes more to excel at your school than just the right credentials. Cultural fit is extremely important for any teacher, whether they're a recent grad or a seasoned pro.
Whether you agree or disagree with the ruling that found several facets of California's education code in violation of equal protection, court cases like Vergara force us to have pointed conversations about education and justice.

Equity should mean real equality for everyone. Most of all, education reform should be aimed at creating an education system that serves all students, and gives everyone a quality education that prepares them for college and a rewarding career.
Our expectations about learning languages are, quite frankly, odd, and ads like \Learn French (or Spanish, or Galician) in 10 Days\ pander to them. While these ads might help sell language-learning programs, they reinforce false expectations.
Education thought leaders around the world speak to the need for more innovative projects like the workshop being done this week at Teacher's College. To find out more, I reached out to the visiting teachers, students and leaders.
In today's information age, an individual's ability to learn is more critical than ever.  Education is becoming a lifelong pursuit and is following the trend of general media consumption.

Network organizations aren't created spontaneously, and many well-intentioned efforts to build teacher networks fall short of developing these characteristics. How can educators move beyond just networking to building strong network organizations?
Last summer my granddaughter, Brooke, played in the U.S. Kids Golf World Championship in Pinehurst, North Carolina.
How do we act on new information, when our systems and structures have been built on a foundation of incomplete or outdated information? How do we adjust what we've built in order to accommodate what we've learned?
This aspect of school reform has been lurking around the edges for some time-- the notion that once we find the super-duper teachers, we could somehow shuffle everybody around and put the supery-duperest in front of the neediest students.
We're not facing angry mobs and jail time, but I like to think that our work is furthering the hopes and dreams of the brave kids who marched in the streets of Birmingham.
This heist by the rich has finally drawn the attention of the media, academics and politicians. But the fact that their politics is also taking away the non-elite's access to culture has barely drawn notice.
\The numbers add up.\ But what of the lesser numbers -- the ones that are, well, less than prime -- and hence, don't quite add up? Was there anyone who would speak for them?
There is a perception that we don't yet know much about the redesigned SAT.  This notion persists because the College Board has chosen to release information in a less than straightforward manner, burying hard fact within vague jargon about measures of \college readiness.\


They never tell you in teacher school, and it's rarely discussed elsewhere. It is never, ever portrayed in movies and tv shows about teaching. Teachers rarely bring it up around non-teachers for fear it will make us look weak or inadequate.
I would not have been able to sustain and increase my interest for learning and thinking had I been only concentrating on the end result. The \process\ and the \enjoyment of  the process\ is the key to success.
In my college classroom I often ask students about their technology habits and, to my surprise, I repeatedly find that this \tech generation\ is not as active as we have come to believe.
Higher education in America fails mostly for the same reason people get fat.  It takes a lot of hard work to be successful no matter how you go about it. But there are options.
he process of debating and revising Jefferson's declaration continued on July 3 and into the late morning of July 4. In the evening of July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress \unanimously\ approved the final wording of the Declaration of Independence.
Should we -- teachers, that is -- be fighting to maintain job protections for our colleagues whose incompetence is at best negligent and at worst abusive? How about we concede a baseline of quality in each classroom?
Students tend to think while in the classroom they are learning everything they need to know to be successful on their job. I have spoken to so many people who have made the statement that you don't actually learn your field until you're actually working in it.
If you do not object to another remake of ET with cell phones added and the sets updated, this film is for you.  The audience was made up of children who all applauded at the end so there appeared to be no objection to this similarity.  The acting is so fine that the evening spent watching Earth to Echo will be enjoyable for all ages.
PhD graduates come in different shapes and sizes; those passionate about an academic career, and those that are not. As it becomes clear that an academic career is not the ultimate goal - panic, dread and feelings of lack of accomplishment may start to reign.
MOOCS are forcing us to think about online education, which is already  here and here to stay. Call them MOOCS, called them distant learning initiatives, call them blended learning courses... the revolution has begun.
We are a well-educated society, so how did we get ourselves into this cycle of putting this financial burden and stress on the teachers who we entrust with our kids every day?

The ongoing discourse before, during and after the Vergara trial decision has tried to blame teachers and further the idea that current policies keep ineffective teachers in low-performing school districts and perpetuate unequal outcomes. Our research suggests voters do not agree with this causality.

If you had six months, little to no resources, and a clear mandate to solve a chronic country-wide problem -- what would you do? As someone who cares deeply about American public education, I believe a certain approach could yield great returns.

On Sunday, June 22, we will commemorate the 70th anniversary of the G.I. Bill becoming the law of the land.  Innumerable individuals have benefitted from this far-sighted policy, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

\So I guess you just deny that there are any bad teachers at all.\ This is a popular retort to various forms of \Your system for evaluating teachers is a lousy system.\ It is a dumb retort. It is dumb in the same way the following exchanges are dumb.
Nationwide, adolescents and teens are routinely grinding through 10- or 12-hour days. They're sacrificing a decent night's sleep, exercise, family time, a social life, and spare moments to simply read, invent, dream, or explore--everything that's essential to a growing mind
Michael Bodekaer, 30 and Mads Bonde, 29, founded Labster, an internationally focused company dedicated to the development of pioneering online tools for teaching science globally.
A common public misperception is that tenure perpetuates mediocrity by permitting lifetime appointments for lackluster professors. In practice, the reverse is true

Judge Treu's opinion unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding of education research and teacher employment law's effects. His decision also erodes labor protections without increasing the likelihood of an excellent education for students in low-income communities.
You would think \Let's pay teachers more\ would be a fairly straightforward proposal. We could raise state taxes or even use some of that free federal money that DC makes appear out of nowhere.
Lengthening the tenure decision process from two to three or even five years will not change the fact that our schools themselves, and the teachers they can afford to hire, vary wildly from district to district, often even from town to town.


No one should sit in judgment of the challenging choices many Americans have to make and the circumstances that lead them to leave school.
If you're not aware of the hottest current digital device debate, you're probably not a parent or an educator.
The most fundamental part of local control is the community definition of what a working school looks like.
Is a given lesson worth teaching? I may not always be sure of the answer, but I'm pretty sure that's the question we should be asking, rather than employing discipline, or demanding self-discipline, or pulling stuff off the walls in hopes that students will devote their attention to something whose value is simply taken for granted.


Blaming teachers for education's problems is like blaming doctors for the epidemic of obesity. In both cases the root causes are societal. There's no rush to blame doctors, because, I suspect, doctors are not unionized and until very recently tended to vote Republican.
The real villain, I believe, is not standards-based reform but the way it was high-jacked by test-driven accountability hawks.

Someday, maybe 12 years from now, they think, all children will be college-ready, even if they live in squalor or have no home, even if they attend overcrowded classes with inexperienced teachers. Are they gullible? Or do they believe the public can be easily deceived?


As a woman of color and a life-long Chicagoan, I try to present to my students a curriculum that is both academically rigorous and culturally relevant. I teach for a better, more tolerant world, and because I know my students are capable of wrestling with the \u201cheavy,\u201d I never hesitate to bring it into our classroom.
Twenty-something years ago, few people contended that it made sense to treat teenagers with 5th grade skills as children, and drill them on elementary-level worksheets. Now, this educational malpractice has been repackaged as \standards-based learning\ and an instructional \best practice.\
Working as an Instructional Coach is a delicate balance of learning how to balance being a coach who frequently talks teachers \off the ledge\ and not losing your teaching credibility.
Neighborhoods no longer serve as Americans' primary social networks or source of friends and advisers. More and more, these aspects of life are becoming part of the workplace; offices have even been called the new neighborhood.
For some kids, education means a chance at a life that is not 14 hours a day of backbreaking labor, risking lives to leave families and toil as migrant laborers across the treacherous border; it means hope for a better future.
As the school year ends for all levels of education, I want to put forward one final quiz especially for our high school and college students to answer. If you do not know the answer to a question, just move quickly to the next one.

I aced every one of those 10-word spelling quizzes teachers like to spring on their students. Little did I know they were secretly trying to identify the best candidates for the school spelling bee. Had I realized their plot, I might have flubbed my answers.

So many people are struggling with their \home economics.\ Even though convenience foods may seem cheap, they're almost always more expensive per serving than the home-made version.
The rhetoric has shifted from condemning the soft bigotry of low expectations and leaving no child behind to declaring that education reform is the civil rights issue of our time and initiating competitions to race to the top.
In both the education and health care contexts, among the more common objections to adjusting performance measures is the idea that doing so represents \setting different expectations\ for institutions (schools/hospitals) based on the people they serve.
As with every other race, obtaining a college degree means facing lower rates of unemployment. For AAPIs, having a college education means shaving nearly 2 percentage points off the unemployment rate compared to AAPIs with only a high school education.

Decoupling? Not going to happen. You can't have a data system without tagging, and you can't have a tagging system with nothing to tag. Education and teaching are just collateral damage in all this, and not really the main thing at all.
How is it that, 60 years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision that ended the legal basis for separate but equal schooling, some public schools in the United States have gleaming labs, libraries and laptops while others lack textbooks, toilet paper and teachers certified in their subjects?
I know that teaching is not the only profession where workers must \get by\ on the resources they receive, but the consequences have the widest ripple effect.

In 1954, Brown v. Board may have seemed like the end of a long struggle for educational equality. In fact, it was the beginning. We face a lot of challenges today in our communities, our country and on our planet.
To understand the impact of Brown, it is crucial to understand Milliken v. Bradley, which is far less well-known. Indeed, the latter decision has in many ways had an even more lasting impact on education.
We must stay focused on investing equitably in our public schools and students, and we must not be diverted by programs that have the effect of re-segregating America's public education system.
On the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board, Congress is set to expand a dual school system. One bound by laws, the other deregulated. One free to select the \winners, \ the other bound to accept all.


If the United States seeks to remain competitive in a global economy, it is essential that colleges and universities graduate more students majoring in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.
Nearly three years later, just yesterday, the Wisconsin State Senate finally caught wind of the investigation through the media, and decided to inquire further.

We can measure and respond to students' behavior much more easily and quickly when education is digital than when it is analog.
I cannot stand CCSS because I know what it is
As time goes on, Results for America is making significant inroads in the policy world, helping political leaders of all stripes get comfortable with the idea of heightening the role of evidence in policymaking.
Why did I write the letter if all of these things are true? Because over the past eleven years, I have been more and more concerned over the 15-20 percent of students who have given up on their education.
There's lots of great science going on on the International Space Station, involving not only professional scientists but tens of thousands of students who have participated in the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program. And now there's another way for kids, parents, and teachers to be a part of the human adventure of space exploration
At some point, we tacitly consented to the notion that providing only 20 percent of the children in Harlem, those that win the lottery and go to charter schools, with adequate teachers, equipment and food, is a morally acceptable public policy.
I'm not out to criticize Louis C.K. or to throw fuel on the firefights over Common Core.  But from the perspective of this particular third grade teacher, I respectfully disagree with him.  Let me tell you why.
The most useful information comes when parents, educators, and others with a stake in education have access to data that help them understand how well our kids are doing and empower them to make better decisions that improve student achievement.

The health of our youth seems to be getting worse and worse.
The impact that technology has had on our children because they are now always connected is that they now have become very disconnected with each other.
We love to hold fast to our points of view without regard to evidence to the contrary. This is particularly the case in so-called educational reform, where most of the prescriptions for what ails education are based on assumptions that are simply not true.
The teachers who are most effective in stopping bullying are the ones who work purposefully and systematically to create classroom cultures in which kindness is valued over coolness.
I recently attended meetings and award events at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Virginia. As always happens when I am on a college campus, I was struck by the importance and value of education.
Be prepared, because I can never predict what they may think or say.  So, here is what my students think is the best way to engage students.
People change, beliefs change, systems change, everything changes. When education doesn't evolve with these changes, it affects our present and future.
Mathematics is all about numbers and number crunching, right?  Actually, no, only part of it is. It's more about curiosity, logic, patterns and beauty, and also has its share of delicious surprise, wonder, intrigue, paradox, mystery and magic.
Here's something education reformers, union leaders and pretty much anyone paying attention can agree on
Well beyond skin color, race matters because historical discrimination created an unfair advantage for whites that will continue to reproduce itself indefinitely, even if all intentional discrimination were to end tomorrow.

If admissions officers do not see the value in a test that is better aligned with the Common Core and continue to assign equal weight to both tests, the new SAT will be in a precarious position as students migrate in droves to the ACT.
What has been fascinating to see since we took the E-Colors into the schools is the speed of uptake that the children and students utilize the process and the primary applications such as Personal Intervention.
America's creed does not guarantee equality of condition, but it does promise equality of opportunity.  Education is fundamental to an opportunity society, and America must redouble its efforts to close its high school graduation gap.
Ever since Beowulf, poetry has been critical to the development of the English language. We are now seeing a form of literary expression disappear without any discussion of whether it has a role to play in modern education.

In my years as an educator, I have spent the majority of my time with teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18, and I have come to one certainty

Godot, of course, was no monster, but Godzilla and Godot have more in common than a first syllable. They are the two opposing faces of despair

This workerless economy isn't going to happen tomorrow, but we should begin to think about it.
Those of us who are staunch advocates of HBCUs must not allow our support to impede a critical, yet objective analysis of what these institutions must do to become more competitive and responsive.

If we want our children to help us preserve, sustain and re-imagine the world, we have to give them a chance to try it now.
Through these proposals, we can provide every four-year-old with high-quality pre-k and serve more of our most vulnerable infants and toddlers with evidence-based, comprehensive services that they need to thrive.
How can the nation's \newspaper of record\ be so seriously indifferent to or ignorant of the major education issue of our day?
Great reading can be done in middle school if we take the focus off standardized testing.
