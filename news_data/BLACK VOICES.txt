For the Black community to respect and trust police in their communities, they have to overcome the unavoidable historical presumption that police disrespect them and will preemptively elect to shoot them first in seeking an arrest. Police lives will matter when police actively show and indicate that Black Lives are as important as white lives.

Muhammad Ali was more than just a boxing champion. He was man for all seasons, poignantly remembered as he lit the flame on July 19th, 1996 for the Summer the Olympic Games showing the evident impact and progress of his Parkinson's disease.
What a loss to suffer, even if for years you knew it was coming.
\No one has ever seen anything like it.\
The documentary \Soul Power\ sheds light on Ali's time in Zaire in 1974.
Ali once shared a recipe for life that he upheld in every way.
From POTUS to Prince, these great men have all praised the Greatest in ways that show the power of representation.
\He could have said, 'mow the lawn,' and I would have been down with it.\
Muhammad Ali was a magical man.
Ali, who died Friday at 74, is regarded as one of the greatest boxers in history, even though his career was interrupted for more than three years. At his peak, powerful figures in government, media, and sports inflicted great hardship on the boxer-turned-activist for following his religious and political convictions.
The Greatest is gone. And when I heard that my mind instantly raced back to 1968. Muhammad Ali by then had become America's official and biggest pariah.
Legends never die. Especially ones that were born with wings. From its inception, the monarch butterfly generally takes about four weeks to get its wings. From the day Muhammad Ali was born on January 17, 1942, until the day he made his transition on June 3, 2016, he floated.
For I don't know how long, Muhammad Ali had been no more than an inch behind me and only me, rubbing his fingers by my ear making an insect sound. Then he put up his dukes.
In his eyes he saw himself as the greatest boxer to ever live and that he was. Muhammad Ali was a Boxer, Philanthropist, Activist, Husband, and a father.
Nothing in Ali's monumental life was given to him. He earned it all. He earned his titles. He earned our respect. Now, like butterflies and bees that have soared in the heat of the day, he has earned his rest.

When writer Ta-Nehisi Coates sat down at NPR's New York studios a few days ago, he got a little emotional.
Again? Amandla Stenberg has schooled everyone in the past about the unfortunate reality of cultural appropriation\u00a0-- but
Learning history awakens, enlightens and forces introspection. But when historical items become icons, the facts take a back seat to dogma. South Carolina finally has taken down the symbol that when I was young I did not fully understand. It's now time for the rest of us to understand the hate such a symbol represents.

Violence is not the only thing wreaking havoc on our communities, and if we are not careful we could lose a generation to a preventable disease -- HIV.
White supremacy asks us, on the Fourth, to consider ourselves one American people. But this too is an injustice, because it asks many to forget the ways in which the promise of America never applied to them and still remains largely incomplete. Perpetuating the myth of American independence, while it doesn't fully apply to all, cannibalizes the very hope of full emancipation and real equality.


Little by little, we are getting closer to a deeper conversation about race -- and what we can do to correct our ugly history so that the actions of the future are not continuously bound by the racist policies and practices of the past. We are not there yet, but this issue isn't going away.
Is it really possible for such a historically marginalized group to harbor such hatred? With all the tireless social activism efforts spearheaded by the black community, it is easy to forget about this skeleton in the closet.
Blacks are expected in a few states to live in the shadows of flag that celebrated and promoted our enslavement under any means necessary.
All lives should matter but in this America, we are constantly reminded that blacks lives have not mattered as much as whites lives. And by proclaiming our target of fully embracing that black lives matter, we come closer to our aspirations of a society where all lives matter.
The physical endangerment that intense hostility toward a group can produce is particularly unsettling when you consider the breadth of damage it can have on how the targeted group thinks about their safety.
The Supreme Court's decision in the King v. Burwell decision is a victory for the millions of Americans who need financial assistance to afford health insurance coverage.
Reasonable people know that we are all in this race quagmire together and togetherness is how we will get ourselves out. There will be no fantasies of a \white\ Northwest bordering west at Idaho, Utah and Arizona. Ain't gonna happen. There will not be a \New Africa\ for \blacks with Atlanta as the capital. Just ain't gonna happen. Give it up.


The film is about growing up and getting over one's circumstances. It humanizes the black male experience growing up in America; as do many of the films that are directed by Famuyiwa.
In the fuzzy arithmetic of their moral equivocation, flag pins matter, firearms matter, border patrols matter, but black and brown lives don't matter unless they can be leveraged for some self-serving political purpose
My protest started by recoloring the Confederate flag black, red and green -- the colors of black nationalism. This was my way of arresting my own anxiety and fear of black erasure, both personal and collective.





As part of my Fall 2015 PhD Research Colloquium course, I extended the opportunity for my Administration of Justice Doctoral Students to begin writing for the masses. Below you will find the first acceptance of this olive branch by Whitney Threadcraft-Walker.
I was reminded on this past Father's Day that no one will live forever here on earth. There will indeed come a time when we will all pass away. The importance and significance of this moment is that I am yet alive.

Every year, the DC HBCU Alumni Alliance 5K Run and Community Health and Wellness Fair holds an annual race that serves as a summertime gathering for friends connected by the HBCU experience, and raises scholarship money for students who will attend black colleges in the fall.

In situations like these, it's always an individual act, somebody's loose screw, and never an examination of the institutions that created him and so many other racist policies and practices.
When a person objectively combines the history of Emanuel AME Church with Pastor Pinckney's political leanings, it is clear that racism was the main factor in the Charleston church shooting.
This is an opportunity for fraternities to not only reclaim some past glory but also, and more importantly, a chance to reinvigorate its membership and play an impactful role in advancing African American civil rights.

While the nation has made considerable strides, the fact is that racism is still a potent adversarial force in the lives of far too many Black Americans. This is evident in chronically unemployment rates in many Black (and Brown) communities. Obscenely high incarceration among Black men.



It's time to redefine what \Blackness\ really is.  If not, Black people will continue to get duped in our own spaces. I don't know about you, but my Blackness can't handle another Rachel Dolezal. Yours shouldn't have to either.
In the past 12 months my brother has been harassed by police twice. Once with a gun pointed directly at his chest. He wonders why the color of his skin makes him a target when all he wants to do is play ball in his neighborhood.
Racism is a direct reference to an enforced racial hierarchy rooted in power and privilege. You can't call black people racist, because black people are not beneficiaries of privilege -- the superiority complex that fuels white supremacy.

What was best about you though was your constant, unrelenting evolution as a man. As a parent, you'd admit your own shortcomings and tell me to learn from your misdoings. Hence my need to to be authentic, true and self-accountable through any obstacle.






This most recent tragedy is not an isolated violation, but an exclamation mark in a long string of violations.




As with police beatings and murders of men of color, there is no special dispensation for black women victims of state violence, no \weaker sex\ clause that mitigates the brutalization of black women's bodies as hypersexualized policed space.
What the documentary the filmmakers have assembled is educational, eye opening, often emotional, sad and galvanizing. As the 98 minutes of footage roll by, it becomes apparent that Jordan's tragedy is a chapter within a much longer book.
To not acknowledge that the current #Carefreeblackboy movement is not a euphemism for rich black men who can afford to do whatever they want safely is inconsiderate and problematic to black survival as well.


That institutional racism exists is not to be denied. That it permeates the very social fabric of America is manifest in our attitudes. There are many costs for these great injustices, not the least being the lives of children. In our schools, playgrounds and pools, America has a problem with Black children. And it is costing them their lives.


A curious case of passing took center stage on social media this week. Enter Rachel Dolezal, the 37-year-old artist, professor and NAACP leader from Spokane, Washington who is allegedly passing as black.
I want to be held accountable and I must hold you to the same level of accountability. I want to be in relationship with you based on truth telling, based on kindness, based on a desire to understand and to be understood.
As Black leaders, it is our duty to preserve our communities. In doing so, we must tackle issues that are at hand and be honest with our constituents. Individuals like Mario Cooper paved the way for us to address the disproportionate impact HIV/AIDS is having on minorities.

McKinney Police Officer Eric Casebolt and several others eventually responded and what happened next was jaw-dropping. Casebolt was captured on cellphone recordings chasing and swearing at the black teens in an attempt to corral them up like cattle.

A collage of song, multi-media and narrative poetry, Notes of a Native Song is as much an ode to the prolific artist and author of the essay Notes of a Native Son, as it is a critique of the canonization of Baldwin's work and the sterilization of his public image.
As upwards of 8,000 clergy convene next week at Hampton University, an interesting yet disturbing subtext has emerged that casts a cloud over the gathering.

Conservative blogs and pundits are at it again screaming that young black males are killing each other with abandon in city after city. It makes no difference that murder rates have drastically plunged in most big cities over the past two decades.



Recent events in Baltimore are a reminder of the need to build \civic infrastructure\ in inner-city communities like Sandtown, the neighborhood in which Freddie Gray lived, a neighborhood I studied closely.






Mosby's courageous decision to prosecute makes her just one of the many black women over the decades who have worked hard to quell the scourge of police brutality. Black women have played a substantial role in bringing national and international attention to the issue, both in the past and today.
If those were black kids rioting at the University of Kentucky after their loss to Wisconsin, or black gangs warring in Waco, Texas, you already know what the outcome would be
The overwhelming success of 'Scandal', 'How to Get Away With Murder', 'Empire', 'Being Mary Jane' and 'Black-ish', makes it clear that black actors and actresses are finally (and rightfully) in demand.
I believe Ambassador Haley's place in American history should be more prominent. For a man who made American history six times, Ambassador Haley never spoke of his accomplishments or the past preferring to concentrate on the future.
The bulging numbers of blacks in America's jails and prisons seem to reinforce the wrong-headed perception that crime and violence in America invariably comes with a young, black male face. The brutal reality is that Waco won't change that. It will be the proverbial one day in, one day out news story.

It is easy to judge Baltimore and say what people should do. Ask yourself if you consistently saw people in your community unfairly treated and stifled systemically; what would be your reaction?


Whenever I learn the tragic stories of people such as Freddie, I ask myself \what do I do if I were to get stopped or tailed randomly by a policeman who sees me as a person of interest?\ Every death requires me to revise my mental checklist. I'm running out of options.
Something remarkable happened as the cheating case, which dates back to 2005, unfolded. Over the last 13 years, Atlanta students have made significant progress on another test, the widely respected National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), administered through the Education Department and considered the \gold standard\ of educational testing in the U.S.

Philadelphia has a long history as an incubator for social justice activism, from the abolition of slavery to the Black Power movement.  Moreover, with its high unemployment and poverty, low wages, and high incarceration rate, the city could become another Baltimore.

From the Met Gala to the Cannes Film Festival to Coachella, high-profile events have recently instituted measures meant to limit or altogether delete the taking of selfies. But you can't tell that to multimedia artist, Rafia Santana, with the debut of her SELFiE exhibition.
Even when we disagree, we owe it to each other to push the discourse with researched rigor, not just anecdotal evidence or conceptions that can often guise logical fallacies.
The public health crisis continues into the lives of police officers as well.  My realization was surprising.  I had not perceived officers as victims in the traditional sense, but there are vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to improve policing.
Given the recent unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, it's time to reignite the debate
Our mission is to build a better world through education and social change, and we believe that we must first start at home in order to truly impact the world around us.



Ebony Costain, the founder of Ujamaa Box, was imbued with the spirit of entrepreneurship by her parents who owned a residential painting company.
Thirty-one books later, Jenkins is known for introducing readers to little known histories of African-Americans in the 19th century, amid tales of complicated and strong heroines and the men who they grow to love.
In the Hunger Games bestselling novels and movies, the rich capital uses terroristic \games\ to control the 12 poor surrounding districts. No young fan of the books or movies would miss the uncanny parallels between the treatment of Balitmore's poor and the brutal jovial wanton violence against Panem's poor.

It's hard for me to celebrate on Mother's Day. I feel the absence of my 23-year-old son, Sean Elijah Bell, who was killed on November 25, 2006. He was out celebrating at his own bachelor party with his friends in New York City. It was only a matter of a hours before his wedding, and I was so thrilled.
Freddie Gray's homicide was not an isolated incident; it was the tipping point. That said, the question now is how to honor this truth?


Is there even any value in my pain, frustration or trying to use my voice? Is there any point in trying to engage my fellow American in dialogue that can bring about awareness? Should I even waste my breath trying to explain to you why Black people are sick and tired of being sick and tired?
During my childhood I was aware that I was different in color from the majority of people around me, but my father and mother emphasized brainpower, not color. Color was what you were, but not using your brain was a choice.
If one examines the Pew Research Center's recent statistical portrait of black immigrants one notices a curious finding. Black immigrants have a median household income of $43,800, but overall immigrants have a median income 9.6 percent higher.
Despite poetic mantras championing the American Dream and romanticized ideas of equality regarding race, gender and sexuality -- laws were not instituted to protect or factor morality.


Maryland State Attorney Marilyn Mosby acted swiftly and courageously in indicting the cops who killed Freddie Gray. But as time has shown, it's one thing to indict and another to convict cops. Let's hope this go-round it will be different.
Like most people, I condemn violent protests, including what took place in Baltimore. However, the violence ought to be seen as occurring within the institutional context that has bred it.
Most regrettably, that there were black police officers involved in the killing of Freddie Gray is a part of our brutal, gruesome history.



Let us hope that the majority of the country will listen, and that racism and poverty begin to be alleviated by government created jobs, real school reform, and social services for the people like those in Baltimore.
Pew Research is just discovering something


While it certainly can be argued that violence in any form is \senseless,\ the violence of Ferguson and Baltimore \makes sense\ to me, because I can understand its roots -- even while, at the very same time, repudiating it.

Look, if you can follow a complicated episode of Game of Thrones, then you can follow this narrative playing out in Baltimore. What makes it worse is that we've seen it all before.

I am not a fan of violence, but I am a fan of the people being heard. Now that it has hit the fan, I pray that we open our ears to hear the cries of a people far too long trampled upon, a people who can take no more.
Nadeesha Godamunne is a full time in-house fashion illustrator/colorist from New Zealand now residing in Brooklyn, New York. Her voice needs to be heard. The creativity of her hands need to be seen. Say hello to Nadeesha.
I'm always wary of the argument that all problems can and should be solved at home. I think that takes some of the responsibility off of other institutions that can bring about social change yet drastically need reform. But the role of parents and families is an important one -- particularly in the prevention of racial discrimination.
From one sentence I realized, it's not for me to understand something I can't naturally relate to, but I must be compassionate. No one owes anyone a detailed breakdown of their personal and private experiences (especially when it can be so hard to put into words). The message is
As more white women turn to bronzers, lip injections, butt implants and the like, black women are still forced to maintain more conservative images in public to counteract stereotypes based on these features.
It is a fact that the story of America cannot be truthfully told without the story of people of African descent. If we are going to close the gap and confront racism, we need to learn and understand others' history and way of life.

Does \black gay privilege\ still hold when trying to negotiate a raise or a promotion? It is one thing to evaluate a person's multiple social identities on paper and quite another to evaluate that individual in person.

No one can deny black men's vulnerability in this society and the recent killings of Walter Scott and Eric Harris are painful reminders, but the fact is black women suffer the same injustices. Silence in mainstream and black America is the only reason why it isn't widely acknowledged.
If you've spent any time online you've seen them. They barge into every discussion about racial issues like belligerent drunks in a bar, arrogance emanating from them like a stench, armed with statistics \proving\ that Blacks are the most violent ethnic group on earth.

As Jewish people across the United States and throughout the world celebrate Passover an remember their past, this is a perfect time to reflect on diversity and the future of the Jewish diaspora.
If Hillary Clinton needs any pointers on her 2016 presidential campaign, she can always turn to Gloria Steinem, Mary Wilson, and Bevy Smith. During the Figure Skating in Harlem annual gala, these women shared their thoughts on what issues Clinton needs to make a priority.


Now that South Carolina has taken this very important first step in arresting and charging Slager with murder, the NCLEO4J along with the Scott family and an outraged community demand justice and accountability.

How does it feel to be a threat? How does it feel to know that your life is less valued? How does it feel to know that there are people in your midst who feel and are more privileged than you by the accident of phenotype?
There's a palpable tug of war on the ideologies of freedom. A progressive society should actively increase levels of tolerance and respect for differences. Unfortunately, this progress is constantly being undermined by law and order agendas that seem backwards and unfair in punishment.
Contrary to popular belief, Black people are not responsible for carrying the burden of white remorse. We are no one's moral mules and neither are we anyone's ethical scapegoats. We are more than that. Much more.
Regardless of their hardest attempts they and their families were constantly caught in this cycle -- a cycle that our country is complicit in creating, supporting and allowing to continue even when it is not functioning correctly.

In a society where we are hit with images that range from young girls beating on each other to assaulting our elders, one must wonder and question where is the love? Where is the love for self and those around us?

Kierra was born into a vocal legacy. Her mother, Karen Clark-Sheard, is undoubtably one of the best and most recognizable voices in gospel music. I flew to Los Angeles to witness gospel royalty for myself.
Men and boys rocking pastel-colored suits and church mothers with huge, ornate hats proved that White supremacy had not stolen our joy or stripped our style. Easter Sunday was a sartorial testimony to the beauty and power of Black culture.







SETTING
Mr. Noah, it's time to bring it. We're ready to talk about the complicated and crazy issues and stories about the mixed-race experience and move the needle on the conversation. And mostly, we're ready to laugh.
Looking for a job can be devastating to your confidence. You begin to question everything. Is it my resume?! Is there too much or too little work history?! Did I not smile enough?! IS IT BECAUSE I'M BLACK IN A VERY WHITE, CONSERVATIVE TOWN?!
Jimmy Dennis' case reveals a great deal about a hopelessly broken system that administers the law, but does not necessarily dispense justice.
One of the things I most enjoy about working with Millennials is that they have the same outlook on life that I do

The fact that you have one student offender who did not play to that gate, and claim victimization, and instead accepted, fully, responsibility for his racist, offensive action, is cause for much hope.

The arches of Yellowstone National Park at the park entrance displays the Theodore Roosevelt quote, \for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\ Despite Roosevelt's rhetoric, the national parks' missions have lacked focus towards African Americans for decades.



Stephen A. Smith is just the latest in a long line to peddle the delusion that the GOP can change its ways and become an open-arms party for blacks.





Despite past voting obstacles, there are compelling reasons for blacks in Ferguson to rush to barricades this time to vote. One is the prospect of a regime change. Another is they could move to dump the racket that city officials have run for years that criminalizes virtually the city entire black population. Another is there's no excuse.






The presence of our African-American first family marking the anniversary of this triumphant struggle was incredibly poignant and inspiring in itself.  But for me, the most astounding part of the day was the president's powerfully inclusive, hopeful, and no-nonsense speech as he called for us to take more ground.
The current atmosphere of police brutality shows that many men of color continue to live in a police state in the 21st century United States. When racial profiling, police brutality, and general discrimination are proven to be systematic in our society then we should all be pushing for actions that create change together.
The overarching desire is not to live in a \post-racial\ America, but to exist in a \post-racist\ America. The goal is not for all races to be considered the same, but for each race to have a private identity and culture that is separate, but respected equally.
Silly, sick, demeaning cracks made by such as the canned Univision host Rodner Figueroa likening First Lady Michelle Obama to a Planet of the Apes character are not new. The long, sordid and savage history of racist stereotyping of African-Americans has been the stock in trade of race baiting and racial ridicule for more than century.













The list of issues in the black community can fill an entire book. Of course, progress has been made. Even so, complacency and satisfaction with our condition in the new Jim Crow Era cannot exist, or further progress will not be made.

These tragic incidents received a mere fraction of the attention they should have.  While the focus of late has been on #BlackLivesMatter, it is important to address the violence visited upon other groups, including religious and ethnic minority groups -- whether by terrorists, vigilantes or police who believe they have a right to monitor and take not only black lives, but brown lives too.
On March 7 2015, the 50th anniversary of Selma, the president recounted the awe-inspiring story of what happened in Alabama in 1965
The realities, not Michelle Rodriguez's misguided and blinded opinion, are the forces at play when talking about the lack of new superheroes of color being created. They are being created, they are just not being created by the big two, so most people do not know about them.


The sketch looks at what policing might be like in the not-too-distant future, and more importantly, what we want it to be. Police body cameras are an important part of that, but just as essential is the way that the footage is used and interpreted.
Fifty years later, we remember the suffering and sacrifices of those who set out to march from Selma to Montgomery that day.  We honor those who gave their lives as they bravely faced the racial oppression during the Voting Rights Campaign. As our struggle continues and as we remember Selma and Bloody Sunday, let us move forward in the philosophy of Nonviolence. I truly believe that is what we owe those who marched toward violence and racist rage on March 7, 1965. Their resolve and resiliency demands that we lift humanity with the principles and the methodology that transforms us first.




Black inequality--inaugurated under slavery and maintained by protean forms of white supremacy--has been central to American society, through to the present day. But where does AIDS fit into this story?



By loving, cherishing, and supporting mathematics education for African American women and girls, we improve our society and empower future generations.
I truly hope Obama ignores the noise and pushes the EPA to set a strong standard that will adequately protect public health based on the science, which is what the Clean Air Act requires.
As we get ready to commemorate Dr. King and so many others who marched to Selma, I would argue that George W. Bush has forfeited the right to march. He does not get to partake in such a solemn and sacred time in our history that moved us forward as a nation when all he did was set us back.
Black History Month is more than just acknowledgement in a newspaper or a special program at the kids' school. It's an opportunity to reflect on how far Black people in the United States have come in their struggle for justice and equal rights.
A multi-cultural group of retired and former police officers met with Rep. Jackson Lee of Texas to share and discuss their varied personal experiences with regard to institutionalized racism and the unnecessary state-sponsored murders of all Americans.
Locks are an unapologetically black hairstyle, from their origins to the growing process. And while natural black hair has been put down for hundreds of years in the United States, Zendaya Coleman was showcasing pride.
Leadership is not simply a place in an organizational structure, it is a discipline and a path -- a calling to become powerful catalysts of and embodiments of transformation.
And Malcolm X stands for self-empowerment. He is proof that anyone, even those who have fallen far, can free himself. You just have to work harder. That's why his spirit is very much still alive in the whole wide world even 50 years after his death.
With very little national attention, transgender victims (especially those of color) are forgotten while their cases grow cold and their murderers often walk free, as in the case of Deshawnda Bradley.

Soon February will do double duty as Black History and Historical Accuracy Month.  The snow brings with it flurries of concern about Brian Williams, American Sniper, and whether Selma got it right or wrong about President Lyndon Johnson.


These are women with family-friendly brands. They have made their livings online by being noncontroversial and avoiding the icky parts of life -- the icky parts that I love to dive into head first. But there they were, chiming in and telling me of their own fears and worry, thus mitigating my own ache.

Though it has a shorter legacy than the U.S.' month set aside to honor the achievements of people from the African Diaspora, those in the U.K. also use various mediums to educate the public on the African-Caribbean community.

There is no evidence that the FBI, other intelligence agencies, or the NYPD had a direct hand in Malcolm's murder. But it can't be totally separated from the well-documented, savage war that the FBI waged against black organizations and black leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., during the 1960s.
Multiracial, intergenerational communities have proudly proclaimed that Black lives matter. But \Black lives matter\ seems to be associated only with Black men. I want to tell you, Mom, that when I chant those three words, when I march, lie in the streets, or raise my hands symmetrically in the air, I do so to assert your humanity too. You are worthy.
True diversity is more than a studio spotlighting a few black mega stars in big production movies and then back-patting itself for its efforts to make diversity a reality.  It means implementing meaningful programs and initiatives.
The challenge in addressing race relations in America has always been struggling to find the right place and time. In order to effectively embark upon that journey, police may need to be their own first respondents in addressing race and ethnicity within their own communities.
The beautiful 18-year old Disney starlet Zendaya looked absolutely ravishing at the Acadamy Awards in her satin ivory Vivienne Westwood gown and her elegant dreadlocked hairstyle. But Giuliana Rancic of E! Fashion Police did not agree.
If \Black Lives\ REALLY MATTER, then we must acquire and exercise the right to vote to insure that we elect officials who will impartially administer the laws and manage those State and Municipal Agencies having jurisdiction over our children and our own daily lives.
I know after my husband and I pass, our kids will be less Turkish than they were when we were alive. And in turn their kids will be less Turkish, and so there's a chance our legacy and history will disappear within just two lifetimes. What was built over thousands of years will be erased in two generations.
In 2014, the Central Park Five officially stopped being infamous
Through painting, writing, poetry and music, the arts have provided me with an ability to express my feelings, thoughts, ideas and imagination in ways I am certain I would not have been able to in my life otherwise.




What shapes our concept of art is personal experience. What expands our concept of art is exploration, adventure and curiosity -- stepping outside of our comfort zone to see and feel more.
This film is a beautiful legacy. It sheds light on a very gifted man who, like many creative people, was raised under difficult circumstances in an underserved area of Pittsburgh. All of his plays were \doors\ into the black experience, and from many eras of the American story.
For those of us who research, write, and teach about the past for a living -- and for many others paying close attention -- the lack of attention given to The Book of Negroes tells a story as rich and troubling as the film itself.
There is a reason we study Russian and European history as an integral part of our history curriculum. History is required from pre-K to college because it is a vital part of knowing how you and your country came to be.

Based on the award-winning novel Someone Knows My Name by Lawrence Hill, The Book of Negroes tells the story of Aminata Diallo, an 11-year-old girl kidnapped from West Africa and her personal and spiritual journey as part of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade.
It is about race. And wariness of bad police officers stretches throughout the entire African American community whether we talk about lawyers or stone cold thugs.  We are united in knowing that we are targeted by some law enforcement because of race.
The ability to access quality health care services for the majority of the black population has been largely due to federal government policies and initiatives designed to address long-standing, systemic barriers to medical care for African Americans.
You may say Dr. King was a Dreamer, but he's not the only one. Do we not dream of a just society, too? Do we not dream of a day of better opportunity, full equality, and hope for all?



The cause of the Black job crisis is not just the economy. It's the lack of power. No matter how \strong\ the economy, we are disproportionately unemployed and in low-wage jobs.
Rather than resisting or trying to change such cries, there is an opportunity for those of us in historically privileged and powerful positions in the culture to listen, learn and better understand the longing behind the words.
This happened in daylight, not the murky suspicion of night. The driver's door was ajar so there was no obstructed view.
South Carolina State University might currently be experiencing financial issues, and the university does need a sustainability plan to lead them into the next 100 years of collegiate education, but closing the university is akin to needing a new roof and deciding to demolish the house instead. South Carolina State will not be served well by closure.
As players brought life and energy to the blacktops, the courts served as the place to realize dreams. With big audiences including players' friends and families taking notice of the passion and skill evolving before their eyes, it was only a matter of time until big corporations began exploring business opportunities.
Saturday, Feb. 7, was the third time I saw Joe Assadourian's The Bullpen, which addresses Assadourian's encounter with the New York criminal justice system. On this occasion, three of the Central Park Five were in attendance. Would they find humor in Assadourian's performance after being vilified by the media and unjustly incarcerated?
The summer of 1969 was the hottest of my life. After the call for black power, I and many activists were facing even more intensive attacks as J. Edgar Hoover's strategy for \counterinsurgency\ unfolded.
When the Black and Missing Foundation, Inc (www.BAMFI.org) began in 2008, 30 percent of all persons missing were of color. Sadly, that number has grown -- seemingly to a new record setting incline.
My husband, whom I married at the age of 22 was my first African-American friend and the first black man outside of our close knit African community that I dated. Not only was he nothing like what I thought he may have been--neither were his mother and sister.
If I hadn't experienced living in that homeless shelter when I did, I don't know where I would be right now, or what I would be doing with my life. What was so powerful about going through that rough patch in my life was that I was able to appreciate everything that I had.

Too often when we do find the strength to vocalize our challenges, our own communities can serve as barriers working to prevent us from truly making progress to build a brighter future.
What does it say about our nation when these facts alone are not enough to merit universal outrage?
South Carolina State University will find it nearly impossible to recover from Tuesday's vote by the South Carolina House Ways and Means Subcommittee to close the university for one year while all leadership and students are swept out of its doors.
You will hear a lot about what it means to be a black woman -- some good, and a lot of it bad. In those moments, when you sit back, confused, and striving to find your own definition of what it means to be a black girl in America, I want you to think about a few things.
At the darkest times in segregated America, I could read any issue of Jet or Ebony and feel content that blacks -- that I -- could still excel in any human endeavor. Happy thoughts, cheer and optimism filled the pages.
Together we can bring more people to the table by expanding feminist narratives and acknowledging the intersection of issues within the larger movement for women's empowerment. To strengthen our movement, we have to address inequality as all women experience it.
Strange, still, is the spectacle of a Southern lynching upon a swing set, a symbol of youthful euphoria now rendered the site of a Black youth's strangulation.
My vision only makes sense to those young men we met in Ferguson, and the future we seek to create if Black Faith will show up.
We'll know all Black lives will matter when all forms of Black suffering, including those from HIV and AIDS, aren't hidden in shame and silence.
In 2013, Jerome Murdough baked to death in a 101-degree Rikers Island cell. This is how a former U.S. Marine met his end.
Now in its 15th year, National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is meant to spark conversations within our community and promote education about the disease, but why? With observance days like National HIV Testing Day and World AIDS Day, why is it important to have a day dedicated to the Black population?

Renisha McBride was black, a woman and human. She deserved to be alive today. Her life and black women's lives matter.

In January, there were reports of four brutal murders of Black trans and gender non-conforming people of color. There has been no national outrage over our lives.

We must tell our stories from the boardroom to the courtroom; and from the outhouse to the White House. That we are at the heart of the American story, and without our story, there is no authentic American story.
The Hyde Amendment and H.R.7 target poor women who are disproportionately African-American or Hispanic. They establish a two-class system of medical care, a concept deemed unconstitutional for public education.

Resentment is an indicator that moral judging is taking place. Resentment is not just some feeling we have. It is an emotion that has intentional and cognitive content.
I'm just curious as to why victims are always expected to modify their behavior in hopes of deflecting abuse from a society that devalues them anyway. Why are we not working to change our cultural ethos?
Thanks to television, the entire civil rights era is part of my personal history, even though my middle class white family never participated in a demonstration. But we were part of it all. Every American alive in the 1960s was, no matter what position you took. I am proud of my parents' views, and how they guided me.
18-year-old Michael Brown had the dubious distinction of being slain three times. The first was, of course, his being gunned down by now former Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson.
Beginning this Sunday February 1, Huffington Post Black Voices will kick off a month-long feature tackling 28 different cultural and political issues affecting Black lives.

We must make sure the movies we create and the stories we tell are accurate and honest so that our children may learn from history.


My dad was a seminary student at Yale Divinity School when the first of three Selma-to-Montgomery marches took place, in 1965. The marches led to the passage later that year of the Voting Rights Act. But a lot of blood was shed in the process.


Dr. King became a martyr for peace, justice and equality. Did his life and death truly change social conditions in the United States? Or, were the federal laws associated with the Civil Rights Movement only window dressing, disguising fundamental inequalities that remain intransigent?

The fact is that race has always been a major issue in America. For many blacks and other non-whites, it has been the perennial issue. When W. E. B. Du Bois stated that \the problem of the 20th century would be the problem of the color line,\ he was right on target.
It's a hard knock life for poor black and brown youth and their parents not because they are not willing to work hard, but because of the legacy of discrimination embedded in the structure of past federal government policies such as the New Deal.


His steely, icy demeanor gave Chris Kyle a steady aim, but didn't protect him from the fragile aftermath of war, particularly Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The film fluctuates between his achievements in battle and his ordeal back at home.

Perhaps the best thing about Justice While Black, by Robbin Shipp and Nick Chiles, is the way that it puts individual faces on the persons, disproportionately African-American males, who are systematically abused by the criminal justice system.

Don't let yourselves forget. Live in this moment. Acknowledge your fellow black Americans in this country and the fact that they are not being treated equally. Engage with this, and prove that we can work towards a better America.




We have not yet seen the film Selma. Pending this, we are surprised and perplexed as to why there should be any controversy about the respective leadership roles of Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr. and President Lyndon B. Johnson concerning the events in Selma, Alabama, January though March of 1965.
On the Friday after Christmas, when the sanitation truck drove away, my neighbor went to retrieve her receptacles expecting nothing out of the ordinary. But as she rolled them back into her yard, she couldn't believe what she found scrawled on the side of one of the receptacles
When I heard there was an event called HennyPalooza that was taking the East Coast by storm, I was intrigued enough to expose my liver to the madness. I also made it clear to the people in my life that the tree wasn't the only thing getting lit this holiday season, so why not?


To quote Pharrell Williams' hit song \Happy,\ \it might seem crazy, what I'm about to say.\ In regard to race relations, there wasn't much to be happy about in 2014. Still, I'm happy and optimistic about race relations in 2015.

The pain of Dominika Stanley over the senseless loss of her baby girl, Aiyana, is unimaginable. Hard to suffer, too, is the crushing weight of isolation and alienation as the world responds to tragedies like that of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown Jr., and Eric Garner to the exclusion of the loss of black women's and girls' lives.

It's hardly the first time that some official or official source in North Korea has gotten caught with its racial dirty linen waving. The verbal war is the outcrop of the deep suspicion, distrust, antagonism, and confrontation that's characterized relations between the U.S. and North Korea for decades.


My parents were terrified that the same racism that they had endured would cause me the same tremendous pain and frustrating limitations as it had caused them. They wanted to protect me from the experiences of hate that they had lived.

It's that time of year again - time to look back at the accomplishments of HBCUs. We present those that we think will have the most lasting impact on Black colleges, the students that they serve, as well as the surrounding communities.
For anyone who thinks it is poor timing to host an economic summit focused largely on increasing diversity in Silicon Valley during a climate of protests against police brutality, here is a rebuttal
This summer, I started a series focusing on the lives of black trans leaders. The second in this series of many to come, is Sasha Alexander, founder of Black Trans Media and the hashtag #BlackTransEverything.
Most of the news stories I've see about Ferguson market and sell fear, and many of the community reactions to the events focus on blame and retribution. This deeply concerns me because blame doesn't heal and revenge doesn't satisfy.



The recent airing of Sorority Sisters on VH1 has many people really upset (a slight understatement). Social media lit up with emotional rants about crying and broken hearts, threats to snatch sorors up, calls for boycotts, tweets to brands... the list goes on. I get it. Kinda.
On the surface, there is absolutely no reason to update the classic Broadway show Annie, which was already adapted for the screen in 1982.  But this multicultural cast redux adds a hip swag to the classic kid's story. This Annie is urban, emotional and fun.  But far from perfect.

I believe the revolution has begun and we are ready for change and soon no one will be able to mislead us and we will take advantage fully of the voice we have on a regular basis. Not just in extreme times, so if you want to be a part of this revolution, look on your phone or computer.
I honor the enthusiasm, the tenacity, vigilance of all who have marched, took rubber bulletts, made financial sacrifices, and found strength to go on anyhow. But as you assess where you are, and you find that this work is in your purpose, grab hold to your lane and stay in it with consistency and persistency.




As women destined for greatness, we have to manage our finances in a way that empowers our lives, brings us joy, and enriches our souls. The first step on this journey to greatness begins with self-reflection and a decision to no longer be broke.
It's not like Michael Keaton's career was kaput, but it seems like he raised himself from the dead with this invigorating performance. Mexican director/writer Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu gave Keaton a plum role.
Pascal's defense, which essentially amounts to a pivot away from the significance of what those emails symbolize, is simply not enough. It does not excuse the magnitude of the prejudice on display in those emails, prejudice coming from a person who sits in a position of power in Hollywood, no less.
Sorry doesn't excuse ignorance. Sorry doesn't change rape culture, racist imagery, and misogyny on a campus that represents otherwise.
I have interviewed Spike many times over the years on TV, but on this day he was among the thousands of protesters in the nation's capital.
Growing up, I learned of how my grandmother taught in segregated schools and my mother attended them, prior to witnessing the race riots that accompanied integration. Though they were before my time, these events, and the role my family played in them, have shaped me.
Marie showed me my own anxieties and fears around commitment and marriage, shedding baggage and losing my own sense of self in an effort to be with someone else.
On one particular Saturday I went to the thrift store in the afternoon, and the radio was playing. \Fellas, call in and tell me two things you love about Black women after the commercial break,\ the DJ said. My stomach immediately tightened. Even though I hadn't yet heard any of the listeners' perceptions of Black women, I already knew in my gut what they were going to say.
We are a new generation of civil rights leaders, 21st century Internet users with our hands and our digital voices raised, calling out #WhichSideAreYouOn?  Our response? We're on the freedom side. We want our digital voices protected by real network neutrality.







As we unravel the ugliness of the past weeks, from Ferguson to Eric Garner, it's easy to get emotional. I sure have. And it's difficult to separate fact from fiction


\Exodus
As in the Arab Spring, young people like the Dream Defenders and Millennial Activists United, protesting police practices in the black community, have created a \free space\ in the national political continuum. What will fill that space when the protests inevitably end?
If you see a black woman you love running herself ragged to hold everyone down and everything together as primary breadwinner and chief emotional caregiver in the family because of the unrealistic expectations placed on her, please help her by doing the following.
Many of the condemnations of police brutality have excluded the experiences of black women who have been brutalized in custody. The ongoing media blackout surrounding the case of 13 black women allegedly assaulted by a police officer in Oklahoma City may be the hardest evidence of the devaluation of African-American women's lives.

The double tragedy in the Garner slaying was, of course, his senseless death but also that his death does not alter the fact that the chokehold still remains on the official books as a weapon that police officers can use. For that, thank the U.S. Supreme Court.
Instead of arguing about whether Mike Brown had stolen cigarillos, or whether Eric Garner should have allowed himself to be arrested, we should adopt the language of \Black lives matter -- all of them.\ We all have a stake in creating a better system. But for that to happen, we have to be in this together.

In a few months the family will appear together in a short film that was written by mom Audrey and directed by Wendell Thomas. In the spirit of art imitating life, the film, Outside the Box, is about an artistic family that tries to bridge the generational gap inherent in different types of musical tastes.
On Dec. 7 I saw Kinky Boots at the SHN Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco.  Words cannot describe how extraordinary it is.
While everyone has their eyes on the U.S. Department of Justice with hopes it will launch federal civil rights actions against Darren Wilson and Daniel Pantaleo, the two police officers involved in the Brown and Garner matters, it's actually equally important for us to focus on local politics. It's there that the power for change lies.
It is interesting that in assessing the situation in Ferguson, individuals tend to retreat to their separate opinion corners. It appears you have to be either pro Mike Brown or pro Darren Wilson. More commonly opinions are expressed in terms of which team (or individual) is a demon and which is blameless. Why is this?




You're right, it is your job as president to help solve this, so how about this


Daddy lives in a quaint house in the same bucolic town, on the same country road, next door to the house in which he was born and raised.

One of the marks of privilege and power is the ability to ignore the cries and pain of those who are oppressed. This is something that happens everyday.
Men and boys killed by police. I can't breathe. Impunity for the killers -- no justice, no peace. I can't breathe.
It's a shame that we so often neglect black lives that we need a hashtag that reminds us #BlackLivesMatter. We can't transform a broken system overnight, but we can be aware.
What is happening in Ferguson is a result of the unfinished business of the civil-rights movement. The process is unjust, and laws have been systematically stripped away, undoing many of the provisions that protected minorities from white terror. Many blacks feel they have been denied all legitimate means of civic redress; thus they have no other appropriate venue to express their angst.



Amongst African Americans there is an argument that Blacks protest louder when White police officers (or Whites with pseudo police authority) kill or otherwise commit violence against Blacks than they do when young Black males kill or otherwise commit violence against other young Black males. I affectionately call the proponents of this argument the \Black on Blackers.\
Andre Allen (Rock) is a hip New York-based stand-up comedian who has stretched his talents thin. He's in a plethora of movies; none are particularly good, though they have brought him fame and fortune.

In my last blog post I wrote, \The president and the attorney general should immediately convene a meeting at the White House of young black men and their representatives and the chiefs of police of most major urban communities....\ Yesterday the president did just that and actually went even further.


A Black person in America is killed by a police officer or a person protected by the state every 28 hours. We take action in the name of ending anti-Black police-state violence and ask that you join us in nonviolent direct action wherever you are in the world.


So as we continue to discuss the events of Ferguson, its ramifications and what it teaches us about American society, avoid speaking with maxims. Regardless of your opinion on the verdict, consider the other side honestly, even when it seems that no one does the same.
We must listen to each other and we must be willing to hear the difference within each other and seek common ground. We must stop the finger pointing because it gets us nowhere. If we want the change we seek we must all be willing to have and open and honest conversation.
This may not be the \American Winter\ to compare with the recent \Arab Spring.\ But it's the start of something significant. And I believe it's time it's time for us to let our young people share the daunting task of cleaning up the mess they stand to inherit.

Is Ferguson the existential reality of America in 2014? The inconvenient truth is that many African Americans see the grand jury decision as further confirmation of their belief that nothing has changed since the Kerner Report of 1968, and that nothing will; a police officer who shoots and kills an unarmed black man will almost always be exonerated.



A native of St Louis, long a New York City expat, I less felt anger than shame at the inevitability of it all. Performers cast in a familiar play with specific roles to play once the curtain went up.



Today, as we celebrate Thanksgiving, be encouraged that even in the midst of such profound sadness and darkness, there are still glimmers of hope and things worthy of gratitude




There is no doubt that black lives matter to the parents of black children. Our fear is rooted not in our ability to love and provide for them, but rather the realization that comes with daily reminders around us that their lives matter only to us.
Black lives matter. Despite what we're seeing in media headlines, the actions of our courts and legal system and police departments everywhere -- black lives matter and black stories help shed light on history of race in America and beyond.


Having failed so miserably earlier this month to express our justified anger at the ballot box, this Thanksgiving weekend, along with its Black Friday promotions, throughout the holiday season, and for whatever necessary days or months to come, we have been given the opportunity to express our justified rage, anew.



Just as many people took the election of Barack Obama as a sign of a new post-racial America, some might take Love's election to mean that post-racialism has reached Utah. But the truth of the matter is that the election of a racial-minority candidate tells us very little about racial relations.




In May 2004, comedian, social critic and philanthropist Bill Cosby took the stage at Constitution Hall in his hometown of Philadelphia. It was a gala commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Brown decision on school segregation.
For the second time in two months, Governor Jay Nixon of Missouri approved the execution of an African American man sentenced to die by an all-white jury. But Missouri and this governor have absolutely no moral authority to execute anyone.
How did it come to this, when the NAACP, Urban League and other legacy civil rights groups are actually propping up Republican leadership in their efforts to tear down President Obama?









Quick Rihanna, check to see if someone stole your diary. This ode to young black chanteuses fighting personal demons feels like the story of her life.

Now that I've transitioned to the rip old age of 35, retirement has been on my mind a lot lately. If you read my blog posts often, you know I often say it's your younger self's job to look after you older self. Fortunately, I've discovered many creative -- even fun -- ways to go about it. I'm also finding fresh new ways to get this vital message out.
African-American men definitely function at lower reading levels than their peers -- male or female. And it is because the education system doesn't teach them how to read. You can't treat the problem without acknowledging its origins.


Next week, California voters will have a chance to vote for historic criminal justice reform in a state that badly needs it. A ballot initiative called Proposition 47 is poised to rebalance California's priorities away from incarceration and towards rehabilitation and education.

I walked the walk, talked the talk, and now had a student ID card showing that I am an educated person. However, this didn't stop a store owner from turning up her nose at me when I entered her shop and having one of her associates follow me around. And this didn't stop the suspicious stares of residents in a small town where I visited one of my friends this past year.


I am a registered Republican. And I'm black. I'm for civil and equal rights. A raise in minimum wage, I'm for a woman's right to choose an abortion. My switch from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party was not about ideology but about power.
During the Weekend of Resistance, activists joined many actions planned by the youth organizers.  On Friday, October 10, despite an intense rainstorm, hundreds marched in Clayton, Missouri demanding that the county prosecutor step down.
Being black or brown isn't the problem. Neither is my childhood dream of having a house full of black and brown babies. The problem is white supremacy. I don't mean the still-dangerous KKK or Aryan Brotherhood. The white supremacy I'm talking about is much quieter.


Fellow graduates of historically black colleges and universities, we can and must come to the aid of our institutions while there is still time to make a difference. Fiscal insolvency and the loss of accreditation are two insurmountable challenges from which I have not known any institution to recover. What follows are some concrete steps we can and must take to support HBCUs.

Discovering these biases shouldn't make one feel ashamed or fearful that he or she is a racist.  Uncovering implicit bias and guarding against it is a responsible and necessary step for anyone dedicated to eliminating bigotry and prejudice.
Westby was white, middle-class, and an attorney, and therefore automatically believable and credible when she voiced her outrage. Stucky was fortunate she was there and did what she did. Others haven't been so fortunate. That will only change when more such as Westby choose to say no to racial profiling.

Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson was tactful and circumspect when he questioned the way health officials and medical staffers handled the care and treatment of Ebola victim Thomas Duncan. Jackson carefully avoided using the \R\ word.




It was at one of these panel conversations that I met and connected with youth activists from St. Louis who profoundly stunned me with their pronounced brilliance, moving determination and extraordinarily inspiring resiliency.


Remember that a word can only be a limiter if it's believed to be a true descriptor of you; therefore, define and live by your own positive words to help make your dreams and others come true.
\You can have an education. You can even earn a doctorate degree. But, you will not succeed unless you value yourself. You must also have integrity, honesty and the ability to think.\

Because many whites feel that US society is now \post racial,\ enabling them to \get their black on\ without a physical presence in the black community, white label executives package black culture and style through white artists without the burdens of racial disadvantage.



Thanks to a recent New York Times article, I learned what makes a black woman appear angry. All this time I thought I was just being a regular person with regular emotions. Turns out, black women are to be extra cautious of our actions and behavior.


The mechanism by which race affects has never been fully understood. Even when accounting for other factors, race exhibits a larger effect on outcomes than can be attributed for.
While the economy, war, and immigration are deeply partisan, this is one issue that is not. For once, Congress can do the right thing and unify under the banner of the \atomic veterans.\ But time is running out.



James Forten's vision -- and the many courageous stories of others along the Delaware -- remind us that freedoms are hard won by those willing to sacrifice to make the world a better place.
In February 2015, the first-of-its-kind Afrofuturism conference, Midnight Vistas, will bring together artists, writers, scholars and activists from across the United States - and throughout the world - to convene.


The publishing industry can't solve this problem, but the relative lack of children's books by and about people of color nonetheless functions as a kind of \symbolic annihilation.\


This year, no one is safe when it comes to the ridiculous onslaught of ignorance about to people of color. Whether it was the media, celebrities, or members of our own community, the backwards advice and excuses for the degrading of our people was annoying.
The stark and wildly diverse perceptions that white and black Americans have of the crisis in Ferguson (and on race in general) is crucial evidence that the racial divide in our nation is still considerable.
Ferguson is one of those situations that forces us to reevaluate where we are as a people, as a culture, as a society and what things need to be improved.


\Ready to Die\ is a multifaceted masterpiece, but its driving force is Biggie's supplication for America to recognize a young black man wrought with the fear and rage of existing in a life rooted in continuing stagnation.
It seems there hasn't been this many black journalists on TV since Trayvon Martin and therein lies the problem. Diversity in the newsroom is not only a necessity but needs to be constant.



Despite the mind boggling charges, and subsequent kid glove treatment of Holtzclaw, there's been no indignant spate of articles and features in the national press on this injustice, no rallies, demonstrations, and marches from women's groups, and most tellingly, not a word of protest from civil rights groups.

To the modern right, black gain is white pain. The more respectable among them have learned that if you pretend to believe that racism does not exist, despite the undeniable evidence, you can perpetuate white supremacist outcomes indefinitely.
We grasp tightly onto our dirty, old habits of prejudice by focusing on the surface issues of race, when instead I believe the world is much more dynamic and simplified if we infuse a larger dose of humanity back into it.


You should love Beyonce. Yeah, that's right. I said you should love Beyonce. You shouldn't love her because she's beautiful. You don't even need to like her music. You should love Beyonce, because she's a black woman at the top of her game. We need it.


Justice for Michael Brown, for Renisha, for Trayvon, for Eric requires that we confront and acknowledge the legacy of racial hatred and violence that infects our communities and has launched the epidemics of criminalization, brutal, abusive policing and mass incarceration.
In our daily interactions with news and pop culture as well as anti-racist movements and protests, Black men become the representation of violence in America. However, Black women seem to fade into the background, as do the women who have raised them, cared for them, and loved them.

Because of the injustice he saw inflicted on his grandparents, Fred Redmond has sought to ensure through collective bargaining that workers receive fair compensation for their labor and that every worker gain entrance to the middle class.
It was worth the wait for Hillary Clinton to speak out. Clinton skipped the platitudes and echoed the uncomfortable truths that black men are routinely profiled, disproportionately pack America's jails and prisons, and get longer sentences than white males.

Let's get real, America.  Only by acknowledging and dealing with the continued importance of race as a principal underlying cause of our deficiencies can we ever hope to deal with and resolve those defects in our nation.

Closing the achievement gap for minority students is always the topic of discussion and it seems to me that we have at least a partial solution right in front of us. Implementing year-round schooling will lead to minority students who are more engaged with their academics.
The election of Barack Obama was the Lexington and Concord in the latest great battle of race in America. We are a nation at war with itself. For all of our desire to move beyond the narrow confines of many of the events of our tragic history, we cannot. The president's election gave new life to what had been lying dangerously dormant for the better part of 50 years.

Could it be that, in a nation that has legalized racial profiling through such policies as \stop-and-frisk,\ the persecution of pigmentation makes African Americans indistinguishable from each other in the eyes of the law -- so much so that all are feared as imminent threats?



Escalating racial tensions, and the puzzled response from white America, reminds us that many in suburbia still have no clue about American's complicated history with race. Taylor Swift's \Shake It Off\ may be bubblegum fun, but it does not deserve a ghetto pass (regardless of her playful \I'm such a dork!\ tone).


The instant Wilson was fingered as the shooter of Brown, the money train rolled into high gear complete with rallies, counter demonstrations, badge-signing parties, and pitches to Americans to flash blue lights on their front porches backing Wilson.








A possible interpretation of the theme song and the show being is that you have to be grateful for the good times (the positives) in order to see your way through the remaining challenges.

The nation's focus on the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri confers yet another opportunity for deeper racial understanding, but like other (too many other) teachable moments arising from the tragic loss of young black life, the opportunity is fleeting and frail.



The events in Ferguson remind us that it important to address allegations of police brutality and to assess the underlying causes of the subsequent violence that continues to occur in that community.

It's almost as if they are saying please don't go away, please stay, because the moment you leave or turn the channel, no one will care anymore. They will go back to struggling in silence and irrelevance.



Some predominantly white school districts in greater St. Louis area are voluntarily cutting tuition for transfer students to ease racial segregation. More districts need to take the initiative to integrate schools, and the state.
One day my grandson won't be six and little and cute. In fact, in 12 years, he'll be the age Michael Brown was on the last day of his life. And it won't matter what values his family has instilled in him, nor what the \content of his character\ is.



The instant the news broke that 18-year-old Michael Brown was slain by a Ferguson, Missouri cop the inevitable happened. Police officials dusted off a well-worn \cover themselves\ template.



I have many nephews and godsons who are growing up Black in cities that are notorious for the abuse of Black boys. I promise them that I will support them with anything that they dare to dream. But what I cannot promise them is safety from the police.
Like Emmett and Trayvon before him, the surrounding details are disputed. Yet, the final outcome is the same. Once again, history may never know what exactly took place because Michael is not here to speak for himself.













You probably know that Jill Scott is a critically acclaimed actress.  But you may not know some of the dues she paid to get there. She discovered the hard way that there is no book, nor dummy's guide to dealing with fame in Hollywood.
All three groups have been dehumanized as the \other,\ the bogeymen that will destroy if they are not destroyed. And all of us know what it is like to be trapped in the ghetto and have the walls close in on them, and all know how it feels when the lynch mob comes.

I am not at all saying that Iggy Azalea is a saint. But I place the blame on the current state of female hip-hop, the forever growing resistance for music taste to evolve and us, the consumers.
Storms of Carnage



James Brown was the blackest entertainer in the history of America. The blackest. There was nothing integrationist about his art, at all. He never tried to crossover. You had to come to him. He was iconic and not just musically.



The 39th Annual NABJ (National Association of Black Journalists) Convention and Career Fair will be held in Boston from July 30th through August 3rd
Lourdes is a self-described black, trans revolutionary, academic and orator residing in Brooklyn.  As co-founder of the Trans Women of Color Collective (TWOCC), she is leading a transformative movement that uplifts the narratives and leadership of trans people of color.
Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul is far and away the only 2016 GOP prospective presidential candidate who has made even a smidgen of an effort to crack the GOP's toughest of tough sales, and that's to woo black voters.
Ultimately, the jurors will be the judges of the facts and what is reasonable. However, where race and gender clash, the black woman usually ends up on the short end of the deal.


Hepatitis C infection is a major public health concern for people of all races. To help increase Hepatitis C awareness, testing and access to treatment for individuals infected with the virus, we recognize National African American Hepatitis C Action Day (NAAHCAD) on Friday, July 25.
For Jennifer Hamilton it wasn't enough to be the only one wishing her husband a happy birthday. She decided to try and get the whole world to say it along with her.
Here we are 50 years later, and if you're a woman of color, then you're still facing inequality in the workplace. According to a recent study, black women are making far less than their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts in the same jobs and positions.
These conversations were always awkward for me and never satisfying.
Privacy is key to having a healthy space. The girls that we work with tell us that they need something that belongs to them where they could do what they want and need to do to better themselves.
On July 20, the NAACP will recognize the Day of Unity, to combat the disparate impact that HIV has on Black America. As an ordained minister, I know the power that faith communities can wield by providing life saving education and advocacy. This is not the time to be quiet. This is the time to speak.
To hell with political correctness, it's time to talk about the black elephant in the room.



I have a four year-old and a one year-old and I can't imagine putting a relaxer in their hair because, like most kids their ages, they are busy-bodies. My mother relaxed my hair when I was four years old and my sister got her first relaxer when she was three. It really boggles my mind now.



When growing up I heard that Sundays were the most segregated day of the week. Not that there is anything wrong with voluntary segregation. But interesting that when left to our own devices we tend to segregate based on race and ethnicity.

The horrid history of racial stereotyping that indelibly links crime and violence with African-Americans can't be ignored in trying to answer the question about why now African-American women are fair game for physical abuse.


I caught up with director N.C. Heikin to ask her what inspired her to want to bring to life the \reality\ of Frank Morgan's life and she graciously took the time to give me some insight into her journey.

In the black community, the number of HIV cases continues to increase. Why?



As a result of these myths, we're putting an entire generation at a severe disadvantage and wasting the lives of millions of people who, with reasonable investment, could become vital contributors to our economy and society.




America in 2014 typically condemns racist behavior in the sports world -- just look at what happened to Donald Sterling. However, we've stood idly by for decades when the object of the racism is Native Americans.



I've always found it a very tragic and sad irony that the same weekend that we celebrate Juneteenth, we also remember and commemorate the loss of life of three heroic Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) members and volunteers
In an unfurnished New York City apartment with bare white walls, Wendell Headley paces the room with an intense energy bordering on unease. He's indoors--at what will soon be the home of an art installation featuring some of his avant-garde fashion designs--but he longs to be outside in the park across the street.


The clash between American's declared values of fairness and justice and the functioning of its contentious and uncaring economic system is a potent deterrent to racial progress.
After so many marched, organized, petitioned, registered voters, and risked their lives and livelihoods -- and some even died -- how do we as a country allow their victories to be stripped away before our very eyes?  If there was ever a time to have a renewed Freedom Summer, that time is now, in 2014.


Because we live in times with extended and blended families, for example, parenting goes far beyond the boundaries of immediate family. As the annual holiday approaches, I find myself thinking about those who act as fathers to a neighborhood, a church, or even a city.




One of the nation's richest and most influential companies with political leanings that weigh heavily against the mission and the culture of historically Black colleges and universities, is one of the largest benefactors to our most vulnerable institutions.
Use of the term \uppity\ has experienced a revival since Barack Obama's election as the nation's first Black President.  More than a few of Mr. Obama's detractors have taken to calling him \arrogant\ and at times, they have dispensed with the veneer of political correctness by even calling him \uppity.\

The stories in this book are designed to educate and motivate our children of all colors (and even adults) on black heritage, roots and the entire black race.




My friends have been writing, reminding me of my Maya Angelou story, of my brief but meaningful time with her.



If you frequently post about the happenings in your life, and your friend list is becoming unwieldy, maybe it's time to pare it down or categorize. Truthfully, in today's world you might as well consider all of your posts public because you really have no idea who is viewing them.
In Bishop T.D. Jakes's latest bestselling book 'Instinct,' he discusses how anyone can and should listen to their gut despite what data may say or which naysayers may surround them.




Some may not see the connection between these two situations, but I'd argue that Ike Barinholtz using a slur that offends black folks, and Macklemore donning a getup that offends Jews, are strikingly similar.



We are in a fun-house mirror period with respect to race. It has been a sobering reminder of the persistence of not only racism, but of those in power who massage its ailing limbs.
It had nothing to do with black pride and everything to do with what I saw in the eyes of that little boy
Education is the last and most precious commodity in the ongoing pursuit of social justice, and African-Americans should consider more seriously the notion of access to better facilities, racial diversity and larger classes being false signs of opportunity and equality.



To some, the strangest part of the Solange affair wasn't the brother-in-law/sister-in-law feud but the fact that a couple of minutes after the physical fight in the elevator, Beyonc\u00e9 walked out like nothing had happened. I don't know why women are shocked. We all do the same thing every day, especially black women.
The blame for the chronic school re-segregation is the deep persistence of housing discrimination, poverty, and the near universal refusal of federal and state courts to get involved in any more school desegregation cases.


We should all do more to challenge the authenticity of the images presented to us and encourage diverse portrayals of black women and men in the media and society.
It seems as if in almost every way Lupita Nyong'o defies the traditional Hollywood standard of beauty. \u00a0She shows us that beauty has no formulas.
African American female servicemembers comprise the highest percentage of women in the military.
If the Clippers win the championship, as the franchise is handed the Larry O'Brien trophy, it signifies that consumerism has triumphed over morality. It makes it clear that we all just want to celebrate, even if the host we are celebrating with despises us.
On June 24, 2014, music lovers around the world will hear a new sound of gospel that hasn't been experimented like this in years.


For many years, the complex social practice of caste in the Indian subcontinent (and to a lesser degree, the South Asian Diaspora) has been the subject of activism and reform efforts.





An African-American presidency does not make a post-racial society, but creates a racial backlash. Black men are the perennial defendants, guilty until proven innocent of no crimes in particular, and everything in general.

Donald Sterling's alleged words about African Americans are poignant to a culture of denial. These comments seem to show a thought process that epitomizes the great American contradiction.
It's time that women of color and feminists alike begin to shift from trying to impose our beliefs and standards on an individual who obviously couldn't care less and begin to empower those who do seek to enact such change.
If our society complacently allows power brokers like Donald Sterling to go unpunished for their prejudice, it will be maddeningly difficult for America to progress towards a more just and equitable future.

Is anyone really surprised by the alleged recorded statements of Donald Sterling to his girlfriend? Hasn't it been well-documented that he has made racist comments such as these multiple times in the past?

There are many programs that offer great opportunities for diverse college students to succeed in media, and they have fostered meaningful learning experiences for young professionals for years now.
She's the self-proclaimed \drama queen\ with sass and vocal power to boot. But KeKe Wyatt, star of TV One's hit reality series, R&B Divas

It's finally time that we have that long awaited talk about measuring black success. For far too long we have given many a pass when it comes to what they say and how they go about navigating what it means to achieve for the community.

We can even flash forward to another famous speech when it was declared that 'all men are created equal' and ask ourselves

Dead are the days when Blacks had no voice. Race is no longer a defining limitation in how we choose to love, marry or serve our country. We are the future we've been waiting. But as you may have wisely anticipated, the struggle for equality continues.
