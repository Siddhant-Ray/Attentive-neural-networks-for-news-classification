Despite the importance of sexual health, many Latino parents, often weighed down by outdated notions of shame and propriety, are failing to provide their sons and daughters with the information to make smart decisions about their sexual lives. The consequences of this silence are crippling.
Donald Trump has no one to blame but himself for the ongoing controversy. If he had shown a basic level of respect for Latinos, he would not be facing growing outrage in the Hispanic community. Maybe the title of his next book should be \How To Lose Friends and Deport People.\

One of the more enjoyably offbeat features at last year's New York Film Festival that is only now seeing the light of day is Martin Rejtman's Two Shots Fired. This comic offering showcases Argentina as a land plagued by emotional neutrality. No smiles. No Howard Beale outbursts. No fidgety tots and no Lotharios aquiver.

Recently, I wrote about the dismal publishing scene for Latino authors. Well, I was remiss in at least one aspect. I implied that Hispanic writers are limited only to pitching the big New York publishing houses or jumping into the self-publishing quagmire. There is another option.
They are not wrought with the insecurities and self-doubt this nation shoves down the throats of those born and raised here at every turn they take. The negative signals come in the form of overt and covert cultural racism.

In order to support investments in education, infrastructure, health care, and many other areas that millions of Americans rely on, everybody must contribute financially through the tax system. Luckily for this country, Latinos are a tremendous asset thanks to their commitment to paying their fair share of taxes.



Senator, we may not always see eye-to-eye when it comes to policy, but we do know that your words always ring with a sense of urgency and passion.  Now how about taking that same fiery fervor and championing causes that truly empower the Latino community?

Six months after Ayotzinapa, the haze of protest fever has cleared, and the long, difficult road to change has come into focus. The pragmatic questions Mexico must ask itself in order to arrive there are ugly. But--short of a revolution--this strategic approach is the only way for Mexico to generate change from below, giving voice at last to the many victims of its ongoing violence.
In the realm of simplistic nonsense, few ideas are more insidious than the claim that you don't need money if you just, well, love each other a whole lot. This sentiment ignores the overwhelming financial stresses that clobber poor people every day.
Latinos have been paying dearly, sometimes with their own lives, for American prohibition without having a seat at the policy making table.
As we celebrate Women's History Month, we must acknowledge the great strides that women have achieved in politics. But if we are ever going to build Latina political power, Latina leaders need the same political encouragement and support that men oftentimes take for granted.



If it sucks to be an adolescent, it sucks more to be an immigrant teenager in a new country. Take all the angst that faces every teen, then add language barriers, cultural confusion, discrimination, and general discombobulation. It's not pretty, is it?
My disappointment with Shark Tank?  Latina entrepreneurs are seriously underrepresented. In fact, I have yet to watch an episode where a Latina entrepreneur is pitching.   This is a problem.
These days, when I go back to Bushwick what I remember isn't what is. The corriente that ran through the neighborhood is gone. There's no Jerry Rivera blasting from passing cars. La do\u00f1a who never left her spot at the window of her second floor apartment on Grove Street, is gone.
We can be romantically involved with, or be children to or parents of people of color, and experience moments of prejudice, and yes, racism. We can have mothers and sisters and wives and daughters -- we can be women -- and fall into sexist patterns of thought and action.
While Latinos have made significant strides in some industries that pay above average wages such as construction, Latinos still hold the highest concentration of workers in the lowest-paying industry -- services occupations.


Undocumented immigrant youth have been at the forefront of the Undocumented, Unafraid and Unapologetic Movement. At the inception of this movement, however, were undocumented parents, fighting the hard fight, regardless if anyone was listening.

Although there are countless parks, streets, libraries, schools and other public places named in his honor across the nation, many students know little about Cesar Chavez. On his March 31 birthday, a number of states will observe Cesar Chavez Day as a tribute to his commitment to social justice.

Many Latino neighborhoods continue to be disproportionately affected by poor air quality. Here in L.A. County, we are in the top quarter of the state that is adversely impacted by air pollution. We have to build coalitions to work with our Latino leaders in the state capitol to stand up for communities that need clean air.
Latino directors should not have to tell stories about people from their own community or country of origin exclusively, but given the scarcity of films that feature prominent Latino characters, the opportunity to do so feels like a missed one.
It's Women's History Month, and Sunday we will celebrate International Women's Day. It's the time of year where we remember women and all our accomplishments, our struggles, our fierceness and our gains. The time of year where women in corporate settings are honored.

Mujica projected, from his presidential perch, the wildly innocent virtue of Uruguay itself -- and magnified it. If Uruguay as a country is part exile, part refuge, Mujica made the country more the latter. One thing is certain, the world will remember Mujica -- the president, the person.

I am Mexican, and I am also American. I am a hybrid. It has taken me a long time to accept that this is ok. I do not have to fall under the pressure of having to choose one over the other, nor do I have to fall under the negative stigmatization that to claim both is wrong.

Racism has long since been an issue in the region. When I was living in a Haitian settlement a few years ago, I saw daily examples of discrimination against Dominicans of Haitian descent, who are recognized for having darker skin than other Dominicans.


At the very least, you can make a movie next year about white women and gender inequality and have the Oscars rally around you. It is never the same for gay people and people of color, as evidenced by the lack of color in this year's Oscar movies.

Five years ago I became a national volunteer spokesperson for the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women campaign. To this day, many people ask me why I support this cause and not others. The answer is that I carry this cause in my heart.
Now, the waiters and waitresses for our area were dressed casually, in jeans and polo shirts. The wait staff for the private party, however, was dressed, well, more colorfully.
With his last-minute decision, Judge Hanen has blocked nearly 5 million aspiring Americans from getting right with the law, working and paying taxes, and living free from the constant fear of deportation and separation from their families.
I shouldn't have to have backlash for wanting to dye my hair another color. But I shouldn't have to dye my hair another color to have something that's my own.
Director Comey said many important things about life in today's America.  But he said not a word about the country's largest racial/ethnic minority.

The real threat to democracy is not voter fraud. It is, rather, those who would suppress the votes of millions of U.S. citizens in the name of \preventing\ it.
For many, economic opportunities like employment or cost of living can have significant bearing on where we choose to live. But, the results of the new Colorado College State of the Rockies Project Conservation in the West Poll tell a different story.

Of the various domestic policy prescriptions of President Obama's 2015 State of the Union address, one message stood out clearly



Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law, more than 15 million Americans have received some type of health coverage. This open enrollment period alone has seen almost 7 million new sign-ups. Still, there are many more to reach, especially in the Latino community, where one in four remains uninsured.

Most human rights advocates would agree that jailing people indefinitely without trial, at times in solitary confinement or other harsh conditions, is hard to justify. The biggest problem with Obama's call to close the military prison at Gitmo is that it doesn't go far enough.


According to the Associated Press, \Arizona became the first state in the nation on Thursday to enact a law requiring high school students to pass the U.S. Immigration citizenship test on civics before graduation.\

In fact, Latinos are the ethnic group that is least likely to have health insurance. Without health insurance, it can be hard to afford even basic preventive health care like check-ups. We can do better for the ones we love, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, can help.
As the film Selma screens nationwide to critical acclaim, police from Clarke County arrested nine students on Friday evening in Athens, Georgia, for organizing the first \integrated classroom\ for both undocumented and documented youth at the University of Georgia.
Before the ink was dry on the 2014-midterm election results, talk shifted to 2016. For the first time in eight years, both parties will be nominating fresh representatives who will attempt to sell their vision to an electorate largely disenchanted with both Democrats and Republicans.

2014 was a decidedly tumultuous year for Latinos, filled with gripping stories, protests, and major letdowns -- among other things, the dip in Latino voter turnout and the congressional inaction on immigration legislation. Along with these we also saw considerable gains, for example, in terms of college enrollment numbers, the number of Latino Congress members, as well as a little light at the end of the tunnel for U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations.
Mayra Arce even resembles Esperanza, the protagonist in The House on Mango Street, one of the 80-plus books that were part of the Tucson Unified School District's K-12 Mexican-American studies curriculum before the program was dismantled under Arizona House Bill 2281. But Maya isn't the main character of a book. She's the main plaintiff in the lawsuit against Arizona.

By re-establishing diplomatic relations, the U.S. will finally recognize the Cuban government as the sovereign representative of their state. Gone is the myth -- promoted by anti-normalization exiles and the internal opposition -- of a hijacked sovereignty that the United States should not respect.
Ankore roams the streets at night, looking for a wall to paint. During the day, he's a soft spoken, earnest guy from Central America who works in a factory for minimum wage; when the sun sets, he finds a wall and begins to passionately paint.

While viewing the fantastic and seemingly-endless Jean Paul Gaultier special exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia in October; my mind traveled back to Puerto Rico.

Colombians have mostly abandoned stories of drug lords and their escapades, of good guys against bad guys, and traded them for a more sober and conscious approach.
