Empty bottles strewn across the floor. Bouts of comically loud and inappropriately timed flatulence. Window-rattling belches. Puddles of drool on every horizontal surface. Lots of daytime naps. Unexplainable temper tantrums. No, I'm not back in college. I have 5-month-old twins at home.

Age and life experience slowly chipped fissures into my icy fa\u00e7ade. Then the knock-out blow, Motherhood, took my frozen blueberry heart and left it in the sun to melt and over-ripen to mush, and ferment into wine whose sweet tanginess I lap up. I grow drunk. And I pass out from... feelings.
Previously, I shared reasons why your toddler may be having a meltdown, and also some tips for preventing tantrums from happening. Today, I'd like to share some tips for taming toddler tantrums when they do happen.

As the mom of three happy, healthy children, I see these summer challenges we're all facing as badges of privilege. So I'm going to do my best -- even when our family is at our worst -- to wear them with honor. Because long after the footprints and crumbs have been wiped away, my heart will linger on the moments that took my breath away, filled me with pride, and made the chaos look beautiful, if only for an instant.
Toddlers can't be contained. The moment you let your guard down, toddlers will do something you didn't think was possible to escape containment.
To so many of the people fighting through this, it can bring an incredible amount of comfort to hear that they're not alone.
One would hope, with all the enlightenment we've had about bullying and online abuse, that we'd be \beyond\ mean girls at this point in time. After all, this is a generation that has grown up under the umbrella of tolerance, so how can they be so hateful to people they view as different?

Our barely 15-year-old daughter has always assured us that she has no interest in smoking pot or drinking. She is a star soccer player and a very good student. We believed she was smarter than her friends, who she told us a few months ago are regularly using pot and alcohol.

The hardest thing about having a child with Down syndrome isn't the child and it isn't the Down syndrome -- it's public perception. It's a lack of funding, resources and research. It's having to fight just to get your child an education and therapies. It's battling ignorance, and it's a full-time job.
Why is the idea of a mother leaving to be with her children at dinner time somehow viewed as a bad thing, and more importantly, as a career staller -- particularly given that when men do this they are viewed as good dads and not penalized from a career perspective?
There is another source of parenting tips I've reflected upon countless times over the last 5+ years since the Little Dude was born. And now I want to share with you some of the great parenting dos and don'ts I learned from one of the most infamous movie fathers of all time, Darth Vader.
To thank you for all you do is not enough. Trying to express my feeling in a sappy card just won't cut it. Buying you a \World's Best Dad\ mug just seemed a little cliche.

Maternity leave is still perceived as a key barrier to women's success in the workplace - so much so that women still talk of a Motherhood Penalty.
All my life I've been impressed by my father's accomplishments, but now something funny has happened -- I realize I'm just as impressed by the things he's never done.
One more thing
No matter how much their fathers may have disappointed or hurt them, all the women I met felt a measure of loyalty and gratitude to them. Fathers matter a great deal not only in childhood but well into adulthood -- and yet few women are truly aware of the ways in which their fathers impact them.
If one does what one can do to make the world a better place, that's all God will ask... it is a job that can make your life worth living, no matter what else happens.
It's difficult to articulate the overwhelming feelings of anxiety that led up to that morning's breakfast. Despite what I'm told are good looks inherited from my mother, I ached more than anything to have a slight resemblance to the man equally responsible for my existence.
Nobody should forget that paid leave is a family issue -- not just a women's issue. Men, like women, want to be good parents and good caregivers for their families. Yet the vast majority of men don't have access to supportive workplace policies that would enable them to do so.
Helping dudes make the most out of life has become my life's work and what better mission than helping to make the lives of the next generation of little humans (and their handlers) just a little bit easier?
My sisters and I could not have asked for a better father in Mr. Taylor, a father who was rightly conservative with his purse strings, but liberal with his two cents. \nEnjoy his Top 10 expressions for nearly every dilemma.
My husband doesn't put in the amount of time that I do with my daughter, but that doesn't make him less than a father, and it certainly doesn't make him inferior to me when it comes to raising our child.
It may be something that's documented in one of those cute baby books, but likely not a big deal in your adult life.  But, when you grow up without a father, making the choice to find \him\ and label him with a name worthy of your love, is a major life event.
I was very lucky to have a father who I could put into a similar class of man as Atticus Finch.  Unfailingly kind, unfailingly fair, unfailingly respectable, unfailingly loving.  Most of my friends have fathers who either fall or fell into a similar class of man...and we are lucky children.
Fatherlessness is a plague on all our houses but there's some surprisingly good news. Any child can have a good dad, and all the developmental benefits that come along with one. Building better fathers is the low-hanging fruit of community restoration.
I'd like to say it was at a younger age when I really appreciated my father.  But sadly, it really didn't occur until college. Because that's when I found out how much he means to me.
From taking the wheel on family road trips to manning the grill at backyard barbecues, you know you can always count on your dad to lend a helping hand. This Father's Day, pay the big guy back with an unforgettable gift that he can use throughout the year.
While kids are counting down the days till \school's out forever!,\ many parents are secretly dreading the final bell. They love the thought of not having to wake up at the crack of dawn and get kids off to school, but they are anticipating being on the losing side of an endless game of keep away from electronics.
Very few things in adolescence are certain but there is one thing upon which most teenage girls agree, and that is, they must be sexy. They must wear the short shorts with their rear's hanging out to fit in and get attention.
If you're still struggling to find that perfect gift, forget the necktie and send dad this list -- something he can actually use at work.
When your second or third or fourth or fifth child is in the same situation, you know what to do already. You've been there, done that, figured it out. But when it's your oldest... your firstborn...\nWe're all first-time moms. Forever.

This year I'm celebrating Father's Day with an empty highchair at our dinner table. A year ago we lost our son Landon to stillbirth at 38 weeks gestation, just a few days before his due date.
We've been off the school roller coaster for several days now. Time is subtlety slowing down, the sun is setting later, and I am embracing the longer days and much deserved downtime surrounded by my kids. But then again, I've had a few thoughts on these first days of unscheduled bliss...
As parents, we need to step off our pedestal, stop dominating our kids, and instead treat them as we like to be treated. After all, do you like being shamed? Does it bring out the best in you?
Should you buy your 10-year-old a cell phone? Let her wear pink lip gloss? Post on FB, Instagram, Snap Chat, and Vine? Date? Wear a bra if there's nothing there?
You are not the unflappable, always composed man that I met, that I thought you were. You are not the father I thought you'd be. You are so much more.
If you have a teen or teens then I am quite confident that you are more than just a little consumed by worry and anxiety. This is an inevitable part of being parents to children who are at the age where they test limits and as a result put you in the unenviable position of having to push back. What a tricky set of dance steps you have to deal with during these years.
Supper tonight was a family favorite

Dads today are much more hands-on and engaged with their children than fathers were a generation ago. The majority want to share parenting responsibilities equally with their spouse but know that their actions are not yet aligned with their aspirations.
Your son is still discovering what makes him comfortable.  It might be a messy room.  Or, not. It's up to him to find out. And if you give him a little room (pun intented), you might be surprised that he's willing to put in the time and energy to have a clean one.  Or, not!
Let's nurse until they are bored of watching... let's breastfeed until no more heads turn or faces flush. Let's normalize it together, as we nourish our children.
A week ago, my husband, my three boys, and I loaded all of our earthly belongings (well, it felt like it) into a rental RV and headed out for a 9-day cross-country road trip to see national parks and monuments. Almost every night we camped in a new spot, and every day we went sight-seeing. On the eighth and ninth days we drove home. As fast as we could.
Although fathers may often seem like silent partners in raising children, their role or lack thereof is quite impactful on the lives of both sons and daughters. As we age and become parents, we undoubtedly become aware of the crucial life lessons imparted by our fathers.
My son will be graduating elementary school later this week. For many parents, this type of event is s a sure fire way of bringing on nostalgia. Maybe some baby pictures will be whipped out and a series of 'remember when' conversations will ensue. I get it. I'm there too.
On Father's Day, if you are fortunate enough to have been raised by a great dad still here on earth, celebrate him with an extra dose of gratitude. If you've lost your dad, I know this day totally sucks.
We've always been straightforward about language in our house. Words are neither \good\ nor \bad,\ but some words are for Grownups Only. Somehow this has worked, and we are extremely lucky Sadie doesn't swear like a sailor. Jury is still out on Polly.


Invite a couple friends over for a Flag Day barbecue and center the poster on the fireplace mantle. Flag Day may not be a major holiday, but by this point you consider it your own. And you're pretty happy about it.
Before I became a mother, I was the girl in the grocery store shaking her head at the mom who was clearly not capable of \controlling\ her toddler. I was the server in the restaurant who tried desperately to give up the table with the family of four being seated.
Fourth of July celebrations are an exciting time and many children enjoy fireworks displays. With a little extra care and bending the bedtime rules, parents and children can sit back and enjoy the fun.
Before I was a mother, I was teaching English in Taipei, driving through Slovenia, taking sake bombs in Japan, sipping absinthe in Paris, dancing on bars in Austin and in bomb shelters in Jerusalem. I even swam with fish in Croatia. Sitting still has never been my thing.
My greatest joy is in knowing that my daughter will receive the love of a truly present father. She will witness a father who supports his wife in the career of her choice and a father who is completely comfortable cooking in the kitchen. She will understand that our gender does not define our roles.


Dads, in the midst of your busy, hectic and frenzied lives there are flashes of joy -- a smile on the face of your child, landing a new client, laughing over an IPA with your friends, acknowledgement from your boss of a job well done or finally making it all the way through a CrossFit class.
Lots of kids start playing around online during the preschool years, but many parents wait until kids are in elementary school to get them started. Whatever you choose, these guidelines will give you and your kid a good beginning.
I know with my soft fur and ears like velvet, it can be excruciating to look and not touch. I hope you can be strong, because along with this handsome physique of mine, I have a set of skills that set me apart from other dogs.
I remember always be the last kid to get picked up from school or sports practice. It was so embarrassing. Recently, my son was the last one to be picked up from daycare. Guess what? He survived, and so did I.
A few minutes of digging went by when I heard a happy shriek, and he came trotting over to me with his hands folded together, cupping -- what I could only imagine by the look on his face -- something awesome.
I miss you when I'm not pregnant. I know it sounds a little crazy. You, the doctor every woman dreads that one time a year, because there are stirrups and cold metal and paper-thin sheets to cover everything and nothing at all, but I mean it. I really do.

My two school-aged girls celebrated their last day as if they were embarking on the impossibly exciting maiden voyage to space. I feigned a big smile and quickly scrolled through my \sitter stream\ and group texted for some steady hours.
From the moment I set foot on the high school campus they were speculations about what happened that day at school. I watched and waited as every student single filed out one by one from school. My son did not walk out.
I first started using YouTube with Evan a few years ago to help him prepare for a visit to a drive-through Christmas light festival. He has a lot of anxiety over going someplace new and not knowing what to expect. We watched a few amateur videos other people took of the light festival so that when it was time for us to go he knew exactly what to expect.
When chatting with other moms, it's quite common for us to roll our eyes and paint the picture that dads are incapable of accomplishing the simplest tasks without our help. Not only is that not fair, but it is simply not true for most of us.
The reality is that all of us -- working for pay or not -- have to handle our daily lives, whatever they may hold for us to relish or endure. What is highly unproductive is for us to stand back and judge. There is no single metric that means we're doing well.

I was scared I wouldn't love my second child as much as I loved my first. I was scared of how my first child would react to having a sibling. I was scared of so, so much that it took away the excitement and happiness of finding out I was pregnant.
With mice, you find droppings. With college kids, you find wet towels everywhere, dirty dishes in bedrooms and Bob Marley posters.



I love \Bohemian Rhapsody.\ It's such an epic song. And with lyrics like, \Mama!!!!!!!\ it was begging for a mom parody.
To anyone who has lost a child, you may have felt you lost everything the day your baby died. What I want to tell you is that you did not lose a thing. I believe these signs are here for all of us to see. We just have to be able to see it. And when we do see it, to know our loved ones are comforting us.
For children ages 4 to 13, the end of the school year means... summer vacation! But, given their age, they can't handle being completely off schedule. Even though they may not know it, they really do need a routine, most of the time.

We moms love a nice get together with our girlfriends. In fact, our sanity depends on it. By the time we peel the last kid from our leg and make it out the door, we're exhausted and the night hasn't even begun. But this doesn't stop us. No way! We may be a tad disheveled but we're more than ready to make the most of our night of freedom.
She is living in moments of her life that are over, moments where sometimes her children and grandchildren don't even exist. Then every now and again, she is jarred into the present. I would like to think she has points of clarity when she knows that the way her life played out was good.
I spend a lot of time teaching students about online safety, reputation management, cyberbullying, privacy and all that a jazz. Of course I hope that when they graduate they will remember every lesson, but frankly, I'd be satisfied if they remembered just the last one.
Yes, families have changed, gender roles have merged, and our parenting styles have evolved. We are a mashup of every cultural nuance that now exists and thrives... and we are raising what I hope will be the greatest generation this world has ever seen as a result.
Basically anything can offend a toddler. You are never safe, pretty much. Consider yourself warned.
Whatever you call it -- a lovey, a comfort object, a transitional love object or TLO, as a former preschool teacher I know says -- that special object to which a baby or toddler attaches is a big deal.
Buy chocolate treats to encourage your child to use the potty. When they refuse to pee or poop on the potty, eat the treats yourself. You deserve a reward for not going insane!
Their eyes widened like they'd just been let in on a huge adult secret. Did I say too much? Just when is the right time to talk about alcohol with your children?
When I first started having kids, I wanted to be perfect. I wanted my little angels to be well-dressed and well-behaved. I wanted my house to be clean. I wanted them to eat healthy. Somewhere around my third child, I realized there's no such thing as perfect. I'm a slow learner.


All Moms everywhere need a break sometimes, and we're thankful to you for providing one. That said, we wanted to share a few things that bring us to angels-singing-on-high-ecstatic levels of gratitude.
As much as no parent would ever want to admit it, it may not always be your child who is the one being picked on. What do you do when your child is the bully? Parents have to understand that at some point their child could possibly be the one bullying. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed by it. How can a child learn if you don't teach them?
With time, I've learned that real love is made of the everyday stuff that cements a relationship over the years, the experiences that build a family, and the security and stability that make a home.
Will the boys resent the time and energy their sister required? What will they have to deal with when my husband and I are no longer here? Who will take care of Lizzy when we can't do it ourselves?

Camp is the one place that prepares you for the real world, even though it may seemingly be nestled in the woods, tucked away from reality.
In simpler times, you could call up your BFF from the OB's office after your ultrasound and tell her the gender of your baby. Now, people can only learn the gender when you release a giant box of pink or blue balloons that float up to heaven and later deflate to choke a baby seal.
As I watched everyone happily posting their kid's prom pictures and making their big college announcements, I was going through something completely different with my daughter. This was the last semester of my her high school career, and nothing was going according to plan.
How often do you have to look across your desk at an anxious set of parents and tell them their child has autism? Based on the most recent statistics of 1 in 68, I'm guessing these conversations are quite frequent. I'm also guessing it doesn't get any easier, no matter how many times you have to do it.
I have three children and have spent nearly a decade as a preschool parent. And -- I have to tell you -- I'm going to miss it. (But not the glitter. I will never miss the glitter.) I'm going to miss preschool because my children's teachers haven't just been teaching my children. They've also been teaching me.
With the number of identity theft cases steadily on the rise, it's becoming clear that identity theft isn't just a problem for adults. Children are the new targets of identity theft fraudsters.
It's graduation season, and time for speeches. I'll leave it to actual accomplished people to say something inspirational and lofty. High school grads, I'm here to keep it real and give you more pragmatic advice. Here are the ten things I wish I'd known when I was heading off to college.
A mother and her child are two parts of a whole, and we need to treat them as such during and after pregnancy. Making sure moms are healthy is how we give birth to a healthy society.
On the eve of your birthday, I hugged you goodnight and whispered, \Happy birthday, Jane. I can't believe you'll be 4 tomorrow.\ You looked up, and with the utmost innocence, you said, \But, I'll always be your baby. Even when I die, right?\
Here is what I have learned
She's right. The gift of having a daughter return to enjoying life again must feel even better than an acceptance to a world-class university.
Allowing teens to grow and feel uncomfortable is vital to their emotional development and is just as important as all that nurturing we provided. As our teenagers graduate, our goals for them should graduate as well.
My daughter is 7. I love the way her mind works. I love the young \woman\ she is becoming. I do not love the fear (mine, not hers) that comes along with it.
Have you ever carried a screaming toddler, over your shoulder, up the stairs and out of a birthday party with your eldest son being dragged along behind as you do? We have. This past Sunday actually.
I don't mind this new body -- it birthed my child and I will forever be in its debt -- but I want to figure out how to be at home in the new structure.
I thought yoga would be a great way to connect with my children and get into shape at the same time. I found many great apps on my iPad, and we got started. Except it didn't work out the way I thought it would.
Sadly, Latin is no longer taught widely, thought of as rarified or, in some cases, even elitist. So, where does a student learn to understand systems and think systematically in today's world?  One word
I've been looking for you for TWO DAYS. I have gone through trash cans, Blue Bear. I have turned over every single couch pillow in this house.
My view of the rite of passage called Riding The School Bus has never involved an iPad or its predecessors. The (limited, but memorable!) experiences I did have on the bus -- on school field trips, back and forth to day camp, etc. -- did not involve a single screen or button. To totally date myself, the bus was decidedly a No WalkMan Zone.
What is a parent to do?  In order to answer this question you have to ask yourself, what is your parenting goal? Is your goal just to end your child's crying or is your goal to produce a well-adjusted child?
The women I am among, the ones who have assured themselves I'm not a voyeur, give me a great deal for credit for my photographic labor. I'm dedicated, I take lovely photos, I'm always around. It's a lot of work. I feel duty-bound to acknowledge that my motives are much more self-serving.
It was over, and I had to deal with it. I had to realize that the expectant chapter of motherhood had ended for me, and it was time to close that book and shift my thoughts from prenatal to preschool.
In addition to asking about your deductible and coinsurance amounts, ask whether you'll need pre-authorization for any of your care, how long a hospital stay is covered after delivery and which common labor and delivery charges may not be covered.

Every once in a while I get a really good glimpse into his world, and it's a place that is unbelievably fascinating. He invites me in without knowing it. I want to stay longer, but that's not always possible.
I tried to get on with normal life, but I'd find myself at a party in London and just be seized with the need to get away, to get to Roger's tree, to water it and make sure it was thriving.
Busy raising my first child, I thought little about the one that was coming. I didn't sing a special song that would be just for me and the new baby. No, my new baby would have to be content with the songs I sang with his older brother.
We as family make the biggest impression for molding those who will lead our society in 2030. I believe in change-makers and guardians of peace, and I believe together we can create a world where all children have a shot at making a difference in this world.

To be sure, some siblings never get over their childhood dramas -- a situation that causes pain for the parents. But many do
If we don't have time in a day to let our children play on the playground or kick a ball on the field together at school, something is very, very broken.
The baby had filled up her diaper and there was no place to change her nappie. Well, there were facilities, but there was no place for him to change her diaper; the changing rooms were for women only, because -- duh -- changing diapers is a woman's task.
n motherhood, our space is constantly compromised. It happens from the beginning, when we have babies nursing and sleeping on our chests. Then, soon after, we have toddlers climbing into our beds in the middle of the night, drinking out of our cups
I was nervous. I'd sharpened my peripheral vision in order to avoid eye contact. I'd practiced witty comebacks to any possible snide remarks. I packed my carry-on with just about every distraction imaginable. Vacations are exciting, but getting there is no longer half the fun
Anyone who's \read\ a picture book can tell you that you don't need words to tell a story. Prereading toddlers and preschoolers can follow a story told in pictures, a parent or child can narrate the action and the empowering experience can help kids develop a love of books.
In my former days, I was a Hollywood publicist. Glitz and glamor were part of the job and planning A-list events was my forte. In the days before social media, I had fashion stylists and couture event planners in my Rolodex. So, how would that transfer into my current role as doting mom
As parents, I think we're constantly learning. After all, parenting is one of the most challenging things in life. So I will continue to learn as I go along, and I will most definitely try to do better. Because no matter how good you are -- or think you are -- there's always room for improvement.
If we want our kids to become successful students, we need to teach them to deal with stress and overcome any self-image crises that may develop
We're not just raising children, we're raising a future. We're raising hope. We're raising the next generation of citizens.
Here we were, two 36-year-old women weeping at an elementary school talent show. And I suspected we weren't the only ones.
By teaching your kids early on the importance of these traits, chances are they'll avoid those false friendships and hold tight to the ones that truly matter.
I was not good enough for my children in the early days. I didn't know enough about them and I didn't know enough about parenting. I was still being me, and I was failing. So I stopped being me. I was a parent and I wanted to be a good one.
There are days I think about you, baby number two. I wonder what sex you'll be and what color eyes you'll have, and I wonder if I will ever see them.

We see you doing those hard things, those honoring things, those I-love-you things, even though it's not easy, just so they'll feel your love and not just hear of it.
We've all been waiting anxiously for the Minions movie for a long time. Well I'm here to tell you that wait is not in vain, and you definitely won't be disappointed with these mischievous creatures. Bring the fun home with Tumblin' Stuart, from Thinkway Toys.

I am afraid because it means having to do a lot of explaining about a subject that is emotionally difficult to talk about with others.
Two of the greatest things about getting older are caring less about what other people think about you and thinking more of the people you care about.
I don't view motherhood as a tidy symbol of false humility. I'm not \saving\ my daughter. I can't. She will need to know how, and I will need to teach her. I don't need to be anybody's hero. That is damaging and dangerous.
I have so many things I still need to teach you about how to be the amazing person I know you can be.\u00a0You're already becoming her, and watching you turn into that woman you'll soon be each and every day has been the highlight of my life for the last 18 years.
It's amazing how shifting our mindset to one of gratitude -- true, deep, fundamental gratitude -- changes lives.
At this point in my life as a parent (8.5 years!), I don't really think about my parenting choices, at least not in the way I used to when my first child was a baby. It basically works, and if it doesn't, I'm too tired to question it.
Work becomes at best a hiccup and at worst a reprieve from the routine of the day. I don't ever want to treat work as an escape from motherhood, nor do I want to resent work from tearing me away from my son.
I want my son to feel that his desire to be gentle and nurturing will be encouraged as much as our daughters are encouraged to be strong and independent.
On any given day, there are Batmans, Supermans, Spider-Mans and several other comic book action figures in the boys aisle of the toy section. Do you know how many female action figures I found a few weeks ago at Wal-Mart? None.
I thought the emotions would be the same the second time around. The immediate outpouring of love. And I did love her but it was somehow different.
At first, I didn't realize the full significance of David's Mohawk, but it quickly became clear. This seemingly small change was a mammoth one in an almost-6-year-old's life.
Every time my 17-year-old has a concert or performance, he says, \Oh you don't need to come. It's OK, Mom.\ That's a lie. It's not OK. They understand if you miss some things, but they really do want you there. They want you to say, \I love you,\ and mean it. It matters.
Always remember that you are teaching your child how to behave through your actions as well as your words; therefore, try to be very mindful of staying calm and positive during this time of year.
For me, breastfeeding has become a part of my identity. It's an integral part of how I see myself, and, of course, it's also an integral part of how my daughter sees me.
My oldest daughter spat up from birth. \It's probably just a phase,\ the doctor told us. It turned out to be a solid eight-month \phase.\ When my second daughter was born, I thought there's no way Mother Nature would curse us with another baby who constantly spat up. We were wrong.
Prom season is here and along with the dresses, shopping, corsages, and Instagramming also comes the not-so-pretty side of prom -- crash diets, higher risks for eating disorders, and fat-shaming.
If we teach our children persistence, it will guide them when trying to succeed in school and beyond. Persistence is not something we are born with. We need to learn it. Don't worry, it is not hard.

Week 22
Of all the things I do as a mother, potty training is right up there as one of my least favorite tasks. The whining, the begging, the pleading... and then there's the kid.
The inner meaning of a mother is the force in us that pushes us to look for the highest in us.\nIt is the higher will to gain the highest understanding of all
I've dabbled into the \selfless mom\ mentality over the years and it never felt good. In fact, the more I obsessed about my mommy role, the more batty I started to feel.
We had an amazing gift, did we really want to jump onto that emotional roller coaster again? If not for those lightning strikes on Little Tree Lane all those years ago, I could very well have been a person who believed you beat the odds but once in a lifetime. But as it happens I was not.
Go ahead and tell your kids they're special as much as you like. Celebrate their accomplishments and let them see the proud gleam in your eyes, but make sure they know you adore them for who they are, regardless of whether or not they win or succeed.
Yesterday, I was an a-hole. Today, I'm, well... I'm a little bit less of an a-hole. I've approached the end of judgment.
When Fruzsina Elo's first child was born he weighed 1 lb., 6 ozs., and it wasn't until he was six weeks old that she was able to hold him in her arms -- on Mother's Day. On that day she made a promise to him
It once again reminded me that parenthood has absolutely no balance. You either are trying to hold on tightly or trying to desperately let go. Trying to keep the door locked and your kid from getting out or open up it up and let him or her free.
Complete the preparations for bed time

My goal is to round out your vacation memories so that when people ask, \What did you do in America?\ you have a better answer than \Took selfies from a metal stick.\
Between now and the end of the year, my husband and two sons, ages 8 and 11, have three separate trips planned without me
Let's hope for more children's narratives with strong girls and women who enjoy romance without it being the only driving force in their lives. Maybe sometimes the stories don't have to include romance at all.
Since becoming a mother, I have learned that all I really care about is that my kids are happy. And healthy. I can only do so much in the healthy department. But, at this stage of this game called life, I pretty much control their happiness. And when I say I, I mean we.
Even before you give birth, advice is doled out to you freely, whether you are receptive to it or not. Everything from how to feed your baby, how to swaddle it or put a diaper on it or look at it or hold it, is heaped on you left and right. Most of it is good-natured. Some is not.
Now that the end of the year is here I can't wait to throw our old school routine out and switch over to pool time, and I feel like if I have to pack another little sandwich into a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle lunchbox I will scream. All I can ask is please, please don't send their recorders home for summer break.
Sometimes we need to remember that our children do not need to be rescued from their wave, that they are more than capable of riding it through to the end and sometimes this is exactly what they need to do to feel better and move on.
Parents who argue, \My child doesn't need to be vaccinated because of herd immunity,\ lack foresight. Some patients are too young to be immunized for certain diseases.

The truth is that you are a great mom. You will raise great kids. Kids who will learn how to enjoy life, love people, work hard and never give up. You will raise these kids to be leaders. Yes, Trudy. They'll learn those things from you. Their working mom. Their mom. You.
Suddenly, my kid was two. And then two and a half. And now, I breastfeed a toddler who is 32 months old and wears 4T clothing. A child who can ask for \mommy milt\ and request to \sitch sides.\
The moment I had my child, multiple people added me to parent pages. Like a rite of passage, suddenly, I was part of this media cult where discussions like what organic lotion to let your kid wear, strollers to sell and play dates took place.
Over the past few years, it seems that what used to be low-key celebrations have turned into major extravaganzas. Social media -- and seeing the efforts that other parents are going to -- are one of the changes that have made us feel as if we need raise our game.
As Mother's Day approaches, I'm reflecting on the example I'm setting as the most influential female in my boys' lives. Unintentionally, I have been teaching them about women. As scary as it is, as mothers our influence on future relationships with women, both positive and negative is massive. Sometimes it takes a small incident to make one pause and reflect...


You get to suffer through me showing up at the park to make sure you're not mackin' it to some chick on the swings. And I know people don't say \mackin' it\ anymore, but it's an awesome way to describe seriously weak pre-teen game.
I also like to think that our parenting style is as fluid as our children are, their stage changes and our parenting changes to meet it. So maybe these type of parents drive me (and you?) crazy today, but tomorrow there's a chance we might be one of them!
To prepare for the arrival of my daughter, fourteen months old this Mother's Day, I turned to friends and family for advice on strollers, swaddles, bottles and more. Many had long lists of registry suggestions, from life-saving nipple cream to hands-free pumping bras (all very new to me).
At eight years old, Thorin had figured out something I didn't learned until my 30s
Modern motherhood takes a toll on women's well-being, strains parents' relationships, weakens families, and certainly doesn't do children any good. My heart goes out to mothers, but I don't \revere\ motherhood.
Mother's Day didn't exactly go as planned. Well, not as Hallmark would have planned it anyway. The first departure from the idyllic script was that I was a little hungover. It was not a raging headache, in fact, better than I might have expected when I went to bed, but still enough to put me off my game.
Having a monitor is important in everyone's life. This is because all of us, not just boys, don't often signal that we need help. Sometimes this is out of pride, but sometimes it is because we don't even have the clarity of mind to know we need help.
All joking aside Happy Mother's Day to all the mom out there. We all feel overwhelmed, under-appreciated and in over our heads at times. We all get honored and celebrated differently or sometimes not at all.
My takeaway

I didn't know we had this in us. I didn't know you had the capacity to become what you've become. To be clear, I didn't think the opposite. I never thought you weren't capable of being a great mom; it's just that I had no concept of the range and depth to which your love could extend.
I'd mentioned a name to colleague and some moron would say something really stupid about the name and immediately, they and that baby name were dead to me.
I'm a mom who takes good care of her kids, but crappy care of her house. I'm a writer who loves to write, but who rarely lets herself write what she loves. I'm a friend who can't seem to write to her far flung friends. I'm just a woman trying to face her shame so it loses the control it has on her life.
With wildflowers, my grandma taught me to see beauty in all things. To see the beauty that lies in the grittiness of life.
If you had to choose one word to describe your mother, what would it be? How about one piece of advice she has given you that has always stuck with you or influenced you in some way?
Just like with regular dating I created a mental \must have\ list. I wanted to be a part of a group of moms more than a one on one situation. I wanted social and economic diversity and basically fun loving people. What I really wanted was moms who were just like me -but not. (One of me is plenty!) How hard could that be to find?

There are several evolutionary principles that explain innate sex differences across species. I shall briefly discuss two such theories of relevant to the unique nature of human motherhood.
I remember those nights of trying to squeeze in two hours of sleep between feedings. I remember yearning for the day that I could sleep a full seven hours without being startled awake. Now that those days are here, I wish I had enjoyed those long nights of snuggling and holding her.
On Mother's Day, young kids cheerfully give their moms flowers, candy, or whatever bauble Dad has helped them buy. But they're often mystified. Why say thanks to mom? Isn't she supposed to take care of you?
Noticing how differently I was behaving with my stepchildren was a giant wake-up call. I needed to be more supportive of Molly and Fiona without being intrusive, to make requests without being so bossy.
My mother taught me how to be the best me, so I continue the cycle to teach my child how to be the best that she can be. To all the mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters, and friends who help raise each other up to be the best we can be, I salute you and thank you for the vows you took to your child and loved ones.
In that moment, being called a \good mom\ was not an assessment of my achievements, but an acknowledgement of me as a fellow human up against a common challenge. Since then I've been thinking, what if mothers reaching out to other mothers was what we celebrated this Mother's Day?

Congratulations on your upcoming bundle (or bundles) of joy! No matter if this is your first pregnancy or your fifth, delivery day is always exciting and a bit nerve wrecking. As a mom of twins, and a mom who had a vaginal delivery with twins (yup!) I can tell you that I wish I had more information on the after birth procedure.
In the early days of parenting and on through the rush of childhood, the dizzying breakneck of high school, we only feel the tasks. We don't have the time to remember, or the time to think ahead that there is an \after this.\
Prior to becoming a mother, I thought Mother's Day meant you should follow mom around all day while showering her with love, hugs and kisses. Oh. How. Wrong. I. Was.
There's an actual moment when we all became mothers. For some people it happened the first time they saw a pink strip on a pregnancy test, for some it was when their baby was handed to them in the delivery room, and for others it happened when they least expected it -- when the weight of equal parts love and responsibility pressed down on them, and their hearts were irrevocably and irretrievably full.
I saw my son shooing me away from the bus stop. \Mom, I know where to go. Can you just wait here today?\
My mornings, they are long. Emotional. Messy. But these years, they will pass so quickly. I will miss the sticky floors, the request for \uppy,\ the feeling of being needed by so many, so often. I promise myself I will try hard to remember this tomorrow.

Parents of toddlers never win. They survive. I love you. I really do. Even with your tangled hair (that you refuse to let me brush), your smelly Anna gown, and your fits of rage, I love you

No, I don't want to be left all alone on Mother's Day with a box of chocolates, the remote and a quiet, peaceful house. I  also don't want to be waited on hand and foot all day, pampered and fussed over, like someone who has just come back from a traumatic experience.
A mean girl is a bully who will use mental warfare and aggression to drag you down every chance she can get.
Being a princess isn't for the faint of heart. It is for the strong. It means that you lead after you listen. It means that you accuse less and encourage more. Being a princess means that you have power to make change, and you should.
I know postpartum isn't glamorous or how models should look on the runway; however, despite how we look or what Mother Nature does to our bodies, we simply want to look beautiful. The moment is beautiful. I want to remember being beautiful.
My mom, with a high school diploma and a tremendous dose of courage in tow, gave up most of her dreams to watch me pursue mine. I will never, ever know the strength that such a choice requires.

\I'm tired of a being a wife,\ my friend Leanne said over our first glass of Pinot Grigio as the band started to play. \I'm tired of being a mother. I need a break!\ I knew exactly what she meant.

It was under the tree house where my siblings and I would play restaurant, serving up birdseed soup and mud pies.  It was in the big red barn that we would play hide-and-seek. It was on the tire swing where we would shout out made-up songs. It was on the screened-in porch where I spent hours filling notebooks with story ideas. We drank from the outdoor water pump after spending a day playing mermaids and Marco Polo in the swimming pool. We would make bouquets out of my mom's flowers and ride bikes up and down the big hill, stopping by the apple trees for a snack.
Love changes with time, with partners, with children, with age -- sometimes in the blink of an eye. This girl did love that boy to the degree she knew of love and for her mother to dismiss it so casually was to dismiss her daughter's feelings casually.
This week in Baltimore makes my concerns seem trivial. I have a close African American friend whose son has gone to school with my son since kindergarten and I worry for her. I can't even imagine how it must feel to send your son away to school and have to worry about his physical safety.
During the thirteen years I ran Kids' Turn, preceded by my years as a public school administrator, it became apparent to me parent education programs were the key to changing patterns in families. Stated simply, people are not born knowing how to be parents.
See, the school day hours are for me to get my work done. But during the prolonged school vacations, the ease and routine of this work day schedule goes right out the window.However, there still is so much beauty in the moments that comprise the school vacation time, even though it might not be ideal for moms like me that work from home and there really isn't any escaping it anyways.
Do you look forward to Screen Free Week every spring? Or do you dread the struggle? Do you categorize it as one more thing to do or have you been brainstorming creative outings and activities all winter for that fabulous family week? If you're like me, you're probably somewhere in between.
Nikolas told me he couldn't wait for baseball season to begin. He loved the game and admitted that he'd never be able to throw as far as the guys on the team. It had been an exciting evening, and for a couple innings, the Twins were catching up. Nikos' homeless friend never showed up, but I hope he'd at least gone to the game.
She hasn't gone through the years that change little girls. The years that make girls doubt themselves and everything around them. She still has the gift of WONDER.
I make my way to the kitchen and crash into my 19-year-old, who is posing for a 'selfie' with his new haircut. \Sorry, Mom,\ he says sheepishly as he posts his picture on Instagram. As I dice onions for dinner, I observe my 21-year-old dancing wildly for his latest Vine video.
This year, I invite you to join me in thinking more broadly about mothering, and in passing along these Mother's Day sentiments.
It is up to us parents to help our kids shift their perspective from the constant need for instant gratification to a deeper understanding of self-control.
As I sit outside the dressing room waiting for her to parade her curated thrift outfit or even during our occasional forays to H&M, I can't help but think of my mother and me in the same scene thirty years ago. But this time, with my own daughter, it's different.
Embrace your messiness,\u00a0dear parents... we probably aren't as bad as we might lead ourselves to believe. My kids taught me that (as usual).
Never, not once, did I worry about the color of his skin, and what that would do to impact his survival. Until I moved to America.
When you live abroad, you spend a lot of time missing out on things
Adam and Amanda welcomed me into their home at 5:30 p.m. on a weeknight, a time often called \the witching hour\ by parents with young children. I watched as dinnertime, their family walk, and bath time unfolded. In the midst of the chaos, I found inspiration and beauty.
Here is a list of truly disgusting things I've done as a mother, and guess what? None of them occurred while lounging in the countryside.
Whenever people ask what you want for Christmas/your birthday/your anniversary/Monday, your first response is \sleep.\ When that earns you a laugh, you begrudgingly accept gift cards for coffee.
I'm sure you've heard it before, but it's true


It's a battlefield out there. You're focused on pushing back that one nagging, silent question that keeps clasping onto you...\was is worth it?\
I am confident that the world my daughter is growing up in will be even better to women than the one in which I was raised. But on those occasions where it's not ideal, I hope that my daughter can keep of some these things in mind.
No matter who a judge deems as \right,\ no matter which party loses his or her case, the truth is, the person who will be most impacted, to either his detriment or his benefit, is the child.
We\u00a0don't\u00a0need\u00a0to carve\u00a0out\u00a0time or cash\u00a0for fancy\u00a0classes; we don't need to drill a 2-year-old on the ABC's to make him\u00a0smart.\u00a0We simply need to\u00a0be present with our kids as we eat\u00a0a meal, give them a bath or brush their hair.
The anticipation. The awkwardness. The fear of rejection. The actual rejection. The logistics. The clothes. The cost. I've been thinking about my high school prom and what went wrong. If I knew then what I know now, what would I do differently?
Three years ago Sprout, cable's only 24 hour channel geared towards pre-schoolers, launched a very \real\ social campaign. Termed #momishere and #nofilter30, Sprout is encouraging mothers everywhere to simply stop taking pictures of just their kids, and jump in the picture with them.
Do you know what we had to cross to get to the store? A HIGHWAY. By ourselves. All alone. At 10, 9 and 6.
I've always thought that if I complained, asked for help, or took a break that it somehow meant I was giving in and letting my struggles get the best of me. Thankfully, I'm here to tell you that that's just not true. It really is OK to complain sometimes.
They are walking, talking, attitude-filled little human beings who still need us, but each year just a little bit less. I'm happy to know them and to have had the experience of carrying them, loving them and raising them... but sometimes, my heart still hurts.
When we moved, the rock went with us. I would see it in the new garden and take comfort that at least something was the same.
When I got pregnant and became a mother at 15, I experienced an overwhelming onslaught of disrespect and shame from family members, friends and perfect strangers.
rands, celebrities and opinion-formers have a moral responsibility to show the truth -- that NO ONE has unblemished skin and that cellulite happens to everyone (even sex symbols!).
Summer is coming up and if you ask a mother what her idea of a vacation is, I'll bet you she censors her answer. What runs through her mind is, \a trip without the kids!\ That's not what she says, though... until now. After reading these hacks, moms will be rushing to their favorite booking site or travel agent, scooping up the best deals!
When Your Kids Become Teenagers (The Bourne Identity). Me
Finding two socks that match is impossible, since the last time they were worn, one was removed in the backyard, the other in the kitchen.
My husband is a tremendous partner, and I could choose to spend the day on my own. But I'm reminded of my mother's words to me earlier this year when I was complaining about all the noise and chaos that a house with two girls under age 4 brings.
Do you know that this boy was born a month too soon? Do you know that in the hospital, I watched him through the glass as warming lights and IVs gave him the things that I couldn't provide?

What in the name of Gloria Vanderbilt was that boy thinking? How did he make it through the school day in one piece? Middle-schoolers are not known for their tolerance and kindness, especially to those who wear mom's slacks to school.
Now, I know this might offend you, certainly my non-parent self would have been offended. I mean, just because I didn't have kids, didn't mean I couldn't have an opinion, right? Sadly, I was wrong.
Right up until last week, I really convinced myself that once son number two had finished school, I was pretty much done as a parent. In 2022 I'd go back to my life as a 32-year-old, circa 2002.
It doesn't end with one conversation. It's an ongoing learning opportunity for all of you. Children are smart, intuitive and very empathic. Their connection to you runs deep.
As with any battle, you sometimes have to change tactics while on the battlefield. We have seen patients through the years have to redefine their description of success when it comes to infertility treatment.
I stand to the side and watch her, at once proud and sad. She is growing up. Learning that letting go can be scary and exciting, but most of all, necessary. And I realize as I watch her rush back to the ladder, it's a lesson I am learning too.
7-year-old's don't give one whit that you have given up your identity or that you are sacrificing yourself for their well-being. So, don't point that out to them. It's the equivalent of blood in the water for shar
Your \mistake\ isn't getting a dog. It's \giving\ a dog to a 10-year-old -- and expecting him to shoulder most of the burden.
I. Am. Enough. You are, too. Say it with me

While some may think getting someone to \do their business\ in a toilet is simple, parents know it is anything but (no pun intended).


Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking with Tomiko Fraser Hines, the first African American face of Maybelline, self-proclaimed \infertility overcomer,\ and RESOLVE ambassador. Seven years ago, Hines was diagnosed with infertility due to premature ovarian failure, an autoimmune disorder.

My 8 year old son has been out sick the last two days. Today, he seemed fine. I told him that he'd be going back to school tomorrow, and instantly his symptoms reappeared. \I'm hot. My forehead is warm. My hands are cold,\ and then the fake cough started up.
Yep, potty training blows. But take heart! The key is to find what works for you, and not determine your successes or failures based on someone else's opinion of how potty training should be.
It was Saturday night and my 6-year-old was bursting with excitement. No, she wasn't anticipating a wild night of braiding Barbie's hair and binge-watching Monster High. Something much more dramatic was happening. The babysitter was on her way.

If you're a parent, you know how hard it can be to get your kids to eat. But comedian Ron Funches faces a special challenge with his autistic son Malcolm.
Maybe their hair will be a little messy in the photos you see online, but what you didn't see is how fast they tied their shoes and were the first down to lineup.
You know that skittish, trapped feeling you get when your children are uncooperative and you're running late? That's certainly worthy of our attention. Recognizing our emotional state requires that we tune in and notice.
The thrill of a successful trip to the potty rivals that of your first kiss, getting a work promotion and winning the lottery -- combined.

I did a lot of things right with my kids. I know that. But there were many things I could've done better. So, here's my self-assessed parenting report card in the hopes you'll end up with better grades.

Oh my gosh! I could see a teeny little light flickering away. It was like the first scene in the movie It's a Wonderful Life when the angels are talking to God up in the galaxy. Every time an angel spoke the stars would glimmer and shine.
\Do you want to know the truth, or do you want to tell a story?\ Choosing the latter, my son told others he got the scars from a sword fight with skeleton pirates while riding a long-neck dinosaur, or that it happened during an epic light saber battle with meddling Jedi.
I doubt parents a hundred years ago had access to 100,000 names at their fingertips. You named kids after your parents, royals or religious heroes. But the sheer amount of currently available information makes any choice almost paralyzing.
As a parent, you may be inadvertently fostering rivalry between your children; as a child, you may unwittingly be the pawn in your mother's or father's attempts at splitting and/or manipulating.
Think about it. Imagine if your spouse put an old picture of you up and said, \I miss this skinny, blonde person.\ That is how teens see this \I miss my baby\ nonsense.
I'm going to say the thing that moms aren't supposed to say. My kids eat chicken nuggets for dinner. Frequently. And... I'm cool with it.
I feel there's an unspoken sentiment that parents should avoid conversations about weight with their children. I beg to differ. In fact, I think parents take a big risk when they avoid this sticky issue.
It matters for every woman who has lost life within her, who has lost the promise of a precious baby in her arms, who has felt like she should be quiet about her story. Because, really, we don't talk much about such things.  We should.
The day prior, I received multiple messages from several sources. Key words in print kept reverberating in my mind. \Alleged threat,\ \police investigation,\ \a list,\ \unspecified harm,\ \social media.\
When you think of qualities you would like to see in your children you may think of empathy, kindness, gentleness, or politeness. But there are some attributes that are often underappreciated or even discouraged.
The kids were gone for a few hours, and when they finally returned, their smiles were bright, and their cheeks were glowing... from both the sun and the massive ice cream cones they'd eaten. And I'd missed it.
I asked if we could just take my kids and she doesn't want to go if my nephews don't come. I'm guessing that means she wants me to help her take my nephews on a trip. I've tried talking to her about this issue and she thinks I am being selfish.

I've gone vegan, vegetarian and periodically nix wheat, gluten, and sugar, all which give me vile headaches and make me look and feel like Mr. Creosote, the exploding fat man in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. Why did I choose these strategies? Not strictly to lose weight, but to gain mental health.
What has happened in one generation to cause a shift in the definition of a bad parent from \someone who lets her kids play Atari all day\ to \someone who doesn't keep her kids inside playing Wii all day\?
My son said the most frightening moment he has ever had was when an airline manager in Denver told us, \If you think he's going to die, don't get on the plane.\
Don't worry about what you did or didn't do yesterday. Don't worry about that long list of flaws and failings no one is keeping but you. Your love and presence are the highlight of someone's life -- the highlight of someone's life. Keep waking up. Keep showing up.
What if we replace guilt with faith? Faith that we can exist in a world where we work hard, take care of our kids but also take care of ourselves and trust that they will be ok.
Whether we want to admit it or not, youth sports are really about education. Our organization says that sports are the outdoor classroom whereby young people are learning a host of life lesson and they are not always good lessons.

Romance shows up differently for different couples. Most of all, sometimes looking too hard for romance the way you expect it might make you miss the real things when they show up.
Every parent of an older (or adult) kid likes to remind you how you'll miss these early days. But I think what those moms are secretly trying to say is that they miss being young, too.
You don't need a significant other to be significant. I wish I'd spent less time as a teenager thinking I \needed\ a boyfriend. Enjoy friendships. They usually last longer, anyway.
In late December, my daughter Annie asked me how to repair a poorly-mounted drawing I'd made for her some dozen years ago. \u200bThe drawing was my attempt to illustrate a favorite poem of ours, \Days,\ by the  English poet Philip Larkin.
There is a large void here. New ceremonies would serve a very valuable role to mark these life stages. Let's start making some now!
All the usual pre-date worries of your bachelor/ette days will haunt you once again. What should you wear? You'll want to look pulled-together, but still casual. You don't want to seem like you are trying too hard.

When trust is established between a parent and his or her child, children feel safer and more able to let the parent take over, even in difficult situations
If a married couple doesn't have any babies, we simply ask them when they will have babies, as if it is a foregone conclusion. If someone has a crap ton of babies, we put them on TV and make them superstars, regardless of their personal character, because hell, they had a bunch of babies.
Peeing. The constant peeing would have been enough on its own to make me dislike pregnancy. Do the pregnancy-lovers not have this problem? Or do they just not mind waddling to the bathroom every five minutes?
You want to keep from them the agony of failure, the pain of rejection and the self-conscious awkwardness of not fitting in. You want your child to walk through the world believing they can do anything and be anyone and that they are special. I get all that. I just disagree.
For those who live in warm climates, I'm happy for you (not really). But for the rest of us who shivered our way through the season with kids tethered to our sides, we deserve a break. We deserve a good old-fashioned umbrella drink.
In public, it is not acceptable to start unbuttoning and unzipping your pants as you are approaching the bathroom, even though this is a timesaving technique when you are home with your children. When not at home, you should also close the door when you're in there.
Parenthood is the ultimate humbling experience. What I didn't know, perhaps what I couldn't have known, were the intangible bits and pieces that actually construct much of a parent's being and often feel more vexing and critical.
In honor of National Siblings Day (April 10), I asked a few of our top experts in the field of sibling relationships to offer the number one piece of advice they've found to help families who are struggling with sibling discontent.
It is very difficult to see our child being mistreated, but even more so when the unkindness comes from one of our other children. And on top of that, it's as though you \miss\ the daughter you once knew. Here are some thoughts that may be of help
Although the age of social media has dramatically lowered the threshold on privacy standards, many adults are still reticent about reporting their suspicions about child abuse and neglect.

During his last moments, when it looked as though he had taken his last breath and his parents crumpled with grief, he rallied and breathed again to give them more time. This was the kind of wonderful boy Wes was.
When your husband asks you for a cup, do you immediately head to the underwear drawer?\n\nIs your floor littered with all sorts of baseball paraphernalia -- gloves, bats, balls, bags, cleats, etc?
It's time to move on. Move on to acceptance. Accept that not all autism looks or sounds the same. Accept that individuals on the spectrum are not valued less than others.
Great communication requires true understanding, so instead of assuming you know what they're saying, get confirmation.
Don't buy onesies, your baby will quickly outgrow them. Buy two piece jammies that're slightly too big, and roll up the sleeves and pant legs.

Anyone lucky enough to share his life with you should accept you as you are, knowing that his life will only improve with you in it. You will contribute to his happiness just as he will to yours. I am passing no burden on to him and he is doing me no favors by marrying you.

Your perception of time and your relationship to it changes. For context, I have four children, and am a widower.

Pablo has plowed through many a social barrier not only for Erin, but for her brothers as well. When approached by this gentle giant sporting his bright blue service dog vest, people naturally let down their guard. Pablo puts people at ease and allows Erin to interact and communicate.
Charlotte's entire life is represented in the negatives that I sorted today. From the day she was born in 1997 until three days before she died in 2004.
Two different parents reached out to my husband and I at the school to let us know their children wanted to help Thorin. I got the feeling I was going to be asked to write college references for these kids someday.
Maybe you just came from the hospital with this little being snuggled to your chest, or perhaps you recently finalized with an older child who has never truly known \the forever\ of family... either way, you are mommies. Real ones. No one can take that from you.
My daughter calmly informed me she was \pumped up.\ They weren't cocky, just self-confident, assured that they knew what to do in the ring, no matter the belt, size or gender of their opponent.

f owning their \no\ is something I hope for my children in adulthood, then I had to let them own their \no\ in their childhood. Even as toddlers. Even while giggling. Even with their mother
As college acceptances and rejections hit the emails of students this week, the plethora of articles on the increasingly competitive process -- one that takes an emotional toll on parents and students alike -- roll out with predictable regularity as well.

The bible recounts the 10 plagues with which God struck the Egyptian Pharaoh and his people. Home confinement opened my eyes to a whole new set of modern-day plagues for parents.
What I hope for you most of all is that by the time you are a mom, we have all moved to a place where moms and dads both have the support they need to make the decision that is best for their families.
I watched your tiny body fight for every breath, hour after hour, day after day. I listened to your hoarse cry, and I cried with you. You couldn't sleep, and I rocked you through the night.
Like all parents, you are concerned about your child's development. Is his development on time, advanced or slow? If you feel concern or worry that something is wrong, it is better to confront it rather than be in denial.
My husband was inspired

Raising our children is the most important job we will undertake. We are not only raising individuals but citizens of the world. Each one of us, and our children, contributes to society in both small and sometimes very large ways. There is no one handbook on how to do it.
Pain is a natural part of life. As long as we keep our eyes and hearts on the rainbow, rainy days are no longer unbearable.
When Harry told me at age 2 that \inside\ his head he was a girl, I have to admit it was an unexpected moment. And it took me awhile to realize that the awareness he'd had of his outer world as an infant applied also to his inner self as a toddler and growing boy.
Easter Day involved family, not things. It was about being together for brunch, not getting on new bikes. And somehow, we felt loved and special without the excess. What a concept.
It is such a simple knowledge, and yet I find that it's the hardest to rely on as a parent. To drown out all the noise, the opinions, the well-meaning advice, the not-so-well-meaning judgment, the guilt, and to just look and listen to my little person and trust that what I feel in my gut is right.
I am the mother of four children, three of whom have autism spectrum disorders. I have had to look three little boys in the eye and share their diagnosis with them.
Kids want to feel that their parents are proud of them. The number one thing they crave is for you to not just love them, but like them too. The truth is when they feel liked and respected, they will bend over backwards to please you.
Potty training your baby means that you're in direct competition with your sister-in-law, your neighbor and moms on sitcoms. And your mother, 30 years ago. (Spoiler alert

The case's effects on pregnant workers overall is not immediately clear. But as an experienced attorney dealing with these kinds of cases, I believe that it will ultimately help make the playing field a little more favorable for workers who have faced discrimination.


We have found a simple space that contains only joy and ease, and nothing could keep me from showing up there. I could run for miles in it.
The way I see it, the culture of \Mom\ hurts men, but possibly hurts women even worse. And it hurts children most of all, who would love to have Daddy nurture them and who may need to have Mommy provide.
We applaud you for choosing life over fame. We celebrate and hope that you will find the peace you seek. Most of all, we thank you.
Other parents understand the urge to brag about every little thing, but social media is a give and take. Be thoughtful about what you're sharing, why and with whom. And make sure to comment, like, or otherwise interact with what friends and family post to keep it, you know, social.
We have all learned something about one of our kid's friends or one of our friend's kids that we are not sure what to do with.
I wear makeup. Not every day, but then, I work from home, so half the time I don't put on my clothes, let alone my face. But if I'm going out and I have time, I'll do my makeup. But what message am I sending my kids?
They were there to cheer on their sister; there didn't really need to be more than this to the day. It was enough.

Here are a few guidelines that I'm trying to use to balance social media as a parent and entrepreneur, and I'd be interested to hear your thoughts as well.

My husband is always doing bath time and reading books at night, helping with piano practice and making it to parent teacher conferences. And on the weekends, it's non-stop between piano lessons, gymnastics, multiple trips to the playground, family dinners and much much more.
Maybe for kids like Odin -- for kids like mine -- inviting the whole class or some dozen kids is only setting up our kids for disappointment and humiliation when no one shows up.
Hi, I'm Joey. A mom of four kiddos on an extreme weight loss journey and this is my day.
As a parent, you can learn the kinds of communication patterns that will make the growth of your child's brain optimized.
Pokemon trading cards rest under the bed pillows. Deflated soccer balls litter the yard. Chewed and still spitty dog toys are underfoot, giving a loud squeak when stepped on. Video game controllers hide in the couch cushions.
Comparing yourself and your children to others will make you discontent and make your family miserable. Enjoy your family as they are and never mind what others are doing.
Your daughters believe you when you say that there are no boys out there good enough for them. Sure, a woman doesn't need a man to survive, but let's not raise her thinking that not only does she not need them, but that there actually aren't any good ones.
Sometime during the day, in the middle of the things that did and didn't happen, your breath caught in your throat (for an instant) as you watched your baby (no matter how old your \baby\ might be, now) from across the room. He is the best thing you've ever seen.
This virtual village is far and wide -- populated by parents all over the world, with all kinds of circumstances. We have the opportunity like never before to learn and share and adjust and improve... if only we could stop burning it down.
A human sperm and egg are the most natural of substances. They are not manufactured chemically. By definition, you are not artificial. You are nature's cherished miracles.
I saw him in Vegas a few years ago and it was an amazing experience, so I vowed if I ever got the chance to see him again, I would sell everything to do it. (I like dramatics.)
As I watch my three children morph from babies and kids into tweens and teens, I become more and more aware that my time with them is somewhat limited. Their world is expanding, and more and more people are entering their spheres of influence.
Some days are going to be tough. You are going to fall into bed at the end of them and be amazed that you survived! But you will survive those days, and there will be so many wonderful, happy, love-filled days that will far outnumber the tough ones in the end.
Even though parents believe that they are responsible for their child's well-being, they're often unsure of what to do when serious behavioral issues arise.
How about when you see me breastfeeding, you don't stare or look disgusted? How about you just go about your business and not give it a second thought? How about you don't worry what your children will think? They will think it's normal if you don't make it an issue.

Easter brings families together through the mystique of a big fluffy bunny, exciting egg hunts, and the first signs of warm spring weather. But what's one of the best Easter traditions of all? The basket!
How did I not know that my best years will always be when you were running through the grass to tell me about your day?
While I certainly want my son to have a positive academic experience, there is more to school, life and ultimate success than grades. Building self esteem comes from more sources than that.
The topic of free-range children hits home for me on a very personal level. With daughters who are 9 and 7, I experience the conflict between my desire to protect them and my wish to set them free

A social worker who was a 20-year veteran of state adoptions told us early on in the process


I was running errands with my youngest two children in tow when an acquaintance of ours spotted us and came over to say hello. She looked at my son, marveling over how much he had grown.\n\Yes,\ I smiled, \He's a big boy!\ She replied, \Such a cute little thug.\ My son is 2 years old.
I'm going to let them cry it out... for five minutes until I go back in begging them to go back to sleep while considering climbing into the crib with them.

Do you know how many doctors' appointments and autism therapy sessions she has sat through, watching everyone in the room fawn and flitter around her sister, Kate?
What seems benign now could be a psychological tsunami someday, with aftershocks for years to come. We parents are essentially imprinting our kids' digital footprint in the sands of time without their consent, with no understanding of the potential ramifications down the road.

I know that I want this for my daughter, for her to feel everything. So whenever she points out her heart I remind her

You told the panel that they changed your life. That they changed your child's life. You were crying. The stories they shared online made you feel connected, hopeful, less afraid.

What Tim Gunn (anyone else who tries to \make it work\) is actually telling us to do is to forgive ourselves, to accept our greatest parenting triumphs and the things we perceive as the fails.
From first kiss to first break up, college application to job interview, we parents tend to plan for every situation, every conversation we'll have with our kids -- except for one.

Although Charlie's behavior was certainly different from Lucas' at the same age, Nicki figured Charlie would eventually outgrow it. \It will get better,\ she told herself. That day in the grocery store, however, she realized Charlie needed more help than she could give him on her own.
Traveling with children isn't easy. There are fights over beds, electronics and pool toys. Things won't always go your way, the weather won't always be perfect and your accommodations won't always be ideal. But choose gratefulness instead of bitterness. People notice.

Keeping your devices safe and secure is vital these days, especially when your children are using them. Here are five tips for child-proofing your electronic gadgets.
As a divorced mother who shares custody, I've had to examine my own assumptions about parenting gender roles and expectations. I continue to own my self-imposed guilt and attempt to dismantle it like a boss.
I hope that I am wrinkled and stooped and able to meet my grandchildren. I hope to tell them about their father, my now baby boy and my then-grown son. I hope to tell them about how brave he has always been.
If you stay silent, I can pretty much guarantee it will be difficult to find the support and love you will so need in this lifelong journey of loss and recovery.
One of the biggest struggles people seem to have with photographing their kids isn't the light or the gear, it is their kids running from the camera. Who can blame them?

I never thought about nannies. I always knew that I wanted to have children one day, and I also always knew that I wanted a career. I just never thought about who would watch those children while I was having that career.
Grant me patience, Lord, but hurry. I recited these words like a mantra on our recent snow day, the second school cancellation in a week. Blindsided by the blizzard, everyone trapped at home again, I steeled myself for the hours ahead.
Twelve days after my mom died, my son was born. I'll never know if my mom let go after I gave her \permission\ to, but it's something that I think about often.
We moms can be so hard on ourselves, and, in turn, so hard on one another. I realized then and there that sometimes the nicest thing we can do for each other is just be human.
She talks pretty much non-stop. Sometimes, it drives me crazy and I feel immediately guilty for thinking that, because some of you have yet to hear the sound of your child's voice -- some of you might never hear that sound.
Stay true to yourself. This might be the hardest task of them all. Even picking one thing you did pre-baby and sticking with it will make you feel better.
Isabella and the teacher presented me with a a story she had written for a school project. They could write about whatever they wanted. When I first glanced at the sheet and caught the title, my eyes began to tear up and I felt a lump in my throat. This is what I read...
Ohhh!\, I said. \I didn't realize you'd left it in a Ziploc bag! Fairies are allergic to plastic! No wonder she didn't take the note!\ So now I'm a forgetful liar. Great.
The news for couples with kids is generally pretty bleak. We're inundated by messages that children can be the death of a good relationship. That's bad enough. But what's even more troubling is that the reasons cited often ring true.
We have become a society that no longer takes the time to get to know one another. Why would we? We get what we need by sending a quick text or email and we're done

Nine years ago, when my first baby was born and those eating disorders and body image issues still stood way too close, these experiences would have really bothered me -- but today I know the truth of it.
Regardless of race, religion, creed, or ethnicity, all is viewed as equal, and in a world where the teenage mindset will compromise even the well-planned and effective parenting philosophies one has, it shows no prejudice.

This year, I took a different approach. I wanted to have a party that was as stress-free as possible for me. Because when Mommy is stressed, no one has fun, especially Hubby. So, what does one Mommy looking for the easy way out do to throw a fun\u00a0birthday party? Outsource.
Children become more resilient and competent when they're given opportunities to be strong and independent, and to practice emotional skills, not when they're seen as helpless and needy. Be with your girls, play with them, enrich their lives with special moments.
I want her to see white and gold. I want her to tell me about it, to show me what the colors look like through her eyes. I don't ever, ever want to make her feel wrong for what she believes, or less-than for seeing it differently than I do.
Many of us have read articles and posts about gratitude, acceptance and \making the best of a situation,\ but we find it hard to actually do it.
Life with two teens and a tween is beyond crazy. I've never regretted my choice to stay home with my children, but lately, the stress of life has been getting to me. I feel as if I'm rarely on my game anymore.


I wade through their words as I walk to the bathroom. I trip over them as I make my way down the stairs. Their words are everywhere.
Here are some parenting phrases that can help increase a toddler's cooperation and reduce tantrums. The delivery of these lines usually goes better with a smile or goofy face.

I can't tell the weather with my boobs, but I totally know that my kid is pooping by the way he is frozen in the corner, hiding behind a bookshelf. It's like I have ESPN or something.


As you map out your schedule, consider squeezing a couple of 15 minute adventures. You'll not only be building happier, more resilient kids, you'll be smashing that 38.5 minute statistic as you build more joy, creativity an adventure into your life and the life of your child.
It never occurred to me that her little brain was trying to put together the pieces and understand the immense sadness that filled our house. She just didn't have the communication skills.
As the parent, remember you are your child's advocate as well as his safety and security. Bedwetting usually does not last for very long, and if you offer your child support and positive reinforcement during this time, he is more likely to be able to come out of it without lasting trauma.
Research shows us that anxious thoughts are often blown out of proportion, skewed, or just plain wrong. Nonetheless, thoughts have power. Why? Because thoughts influence feelings and behaviors.
As parents, we all strive to teach our children manners and how to be respectful, courteous and kind to everyone they meet. It's what good parents do to raise good kids.
No matter what, those first few months will be beautifully difficult; however, there are a few things that I've learned throughout my mothering journey that could help you through...
She is both crushingly disabled by autism and absolutely, emphatically her own self. She is a gift, that much is true. But her autism, like my missing fingers or my damaged DNA, is not.
Many parents think that as soon as their kids learn to read on their own, they no longer need to be read to. But kids still love it and benefit from it as they hear the rhythm of the language, learn correct pronunciation and get to relax and just take it all in.
Only a few people know my true Dr. Seuss feelings because, as a reading specialist and former high school English teacher, I've been afraid to admit it.
In addition to simply reading aloud together, there are a myriad of activities that you can do with your child to help encourage good reading habits and develop a lifelong love of reading.
With two young boys, there is no question that my husband and I are in the thick of it. And so are most of our friends. We are in a beautiful, yet sometimes overwhelming, season of life.
There is one thing I force my kids to do. A daily ritual on which I will not compromise. A foundation that will make any of their other interests possible, probable, and positive. I call it our Family Creed.
I think there are certain TYPES of books that every kid should be exposed to -- the kinds of books that truly introduce them to the best of what the written word has to offer.
If children come to feel like trophies, they start to feel they are valued not for who they are, but for what they do and how good they make you look, breeding unhappiness.
I know in my heart that the best days I had before I knew the four most important people in my life can't even hold a candle to my worst day being a wife and mom.
This case shows what the system of laws, and the courts that enforce them, think about parenting

He's at a point in life where he could really use fatherly advice. He's also at an age where he's convinced his dad knows nothing. That's why I wanted to share this.
We all have cabin fever and are dreaming of the beach. But here's a list of some ways to shake the cold. Before you know it, you'll find yourself complaining about the heat.
You were once an expert at being present, and you can be once again. Here are some fun ways that you can practice mindfulness as inspired by a child.
Forget soccer games and violin lessons, teach your kids something really cool -- bridge. Sure the average age of bridge players is closer to 70 than 7, but there are some really awesome reasons to teach your child this amazing game. Here are seven!
Motherhood has such a strange dichotomy. It is life-giving and exhausting. It constantly exercises my faith, tests my patience, and stretches my heart. But, as a result, my faith and patience are stronger.
While each day a mom makes sure her family's to-do list is done, she often struggles to find time for herself. Without mommy care, fatigue can set in and energies may deplete causing a physical breakdown.
I love this thing. I grew up with two sisters, so we lived by \majority rules.\ But I'm tellin' ya, parents of two kids, The Decider Coin is the perfect solution to sibling bickering. Stop throwing your hands up in the air; throw The Decider Coin instead.
Ditch the admonitions to play nicely. Life isn't fair and nice is for suckers. Focus on the resume and tell your kid to toddler-up. The sooner your kid understands that reality, the sooner he can start to amass a resume of victories, conquests and other toddler superlatives that will knock the socks off of the college admissions committees.

The following list was compiled by my wife, me, and a few other guilty parties whose names will be protected until my death. They know who they are, and they don't feel guilty, either.
Who you are and what you have to say and what you have to offer and what you think matters. I want you to learn how to speak your mind. If you have a good idea, share it, because your words have value.

He gained wonderful friendships, and learned that he can do certain things like ride a bike, build a car or rocket, speak in front of others and learn responsibility.
We can't just be compassionate when it comes easily. Having compassion requires taking a virtual trip into the dark depths of those who do wrong by us, or by others, learning their stories, letting go of anger, disappointment or embarrassment, and moving on.
In the latest trailer for the film, the swoony prince slips his big, strong hand around Cinderella's and draws her close. His eyes burn with purpose, his passion palpable. My husband gets the same look in his eyes when the Thanksgiving turkey is set before him in all of its basted glory.
All the things I take for granted as just being \the way it is\ are totally foreign to someone who lives in the south. So I've put together the little video above, which shows just some of the things we deal with on a daily basis. Enjoy!
Yes, it may be that one child with a peanut allergy makes your whole school nut free. Isn't it worth protecting even one child? Is your kid's peanut butter sandwich really worth that much to you?
How can I \celebrate\ with my in-laws who are both having a second birthday without their beloved son? How can I lighten up when I worry so much about my daughter? How can I lighten up when I'm grieving my love of 20-something years?
Maybe I see it as a setback in our battle against a society that is pushing my girls to be a certain thing, to act a certain way. Maybe.
Shelly is at that stage where she still rents a stroller and sets up play-dates and all of that new mom fun stuff. I miss those days.
Though the walls are gone, the people who were inside them will continue to hold each other up. And while that family will build a new house -- new walls -- the truth is, wherever they are together, that's where they'll be right at home. (Even if it takes a few more tear-stained pillows to realize it.)
You should know that I admire the fact that you know what you want and you won't let society, men, judging moms or your own moms convince you otherwise. I admire that you stand in your own truth and seek the life you want. To me, childless means thoughtful, evolved and strong.
My husband wants to adopt my daughter. And I want my daughter to be adopted by him. This journey, which we've discussed since before we married more than two years ago, is now coming to fruition.
Don't get me wrong. I am a faithful car seat user, but I do own to some bitterness about it. I would be lying if I said there weren't times I wanted to drive to the nearest Good Will, pull all of the car seats from the car, drop them off and be done with it. Then, a few months ago, something happened that forever changed my attitude about car seats.
Kellee Mayfield keeps hearts beating, literally, as a sales and clinical specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators. She's also a talented painter, and writes about life in southeast Arkansas on her popular blog Delta Moxie.

Society seems to be sending mixed messages -- dads should be more involved in their child's care, but spending some time at preschool, or Saturday morning teaching their child to swim or enjoy music, isn't something they need to be doing. That's the mom's domain.
There are days when I wish there was a return/exchange lane for my children. Sort of like Costco's no-questions-asked return policy.
Several years ago, I was dropping my daughter off at preschool when her teacher asked, \What did you do last night?\ My daughter replied cheerfully, \We had vagina pizza!\
I'm sitting at Starbucks. It's 7:05 p.m.. I have a notebook with me. I have doubts about trying to record my thoughts here, in this way, but I've seen so many people do it, that I am willing to give it a go.
I love Eileen's reminders about expectations -- the ones we set our for ourselves and the ones others set for us.
As a kid, I can remember the excitement when it started to stick, hoping and hoping that the ground would be white when I woke up and school would be out the next day.
Everything feels REALLY MONUMENTAL right now, but if you could just stop and repeat these words silently to yourself, \ Will this matter in a year from now?\ I promise you that your perspective will shift.
Fear isn't weakness; it simply creates opportunity for courage. It's OK be to afraid. Tears aren't weakness, either. Crying means you have the strength to acknowledge and express your emotions.
Before he could talk, he was wearing my high heels. Sometimes I would let him wear them to the store, and this was in DC, so it's not common.
When we sit together in your nursery, cuddled chest to chest, I feel the weight of glory pressed upon me despite the uncertainty that always tries to take over.

When I was pregnant, I had many opinions and ideas about what life would be like after I had children -- how I was going to be as a parent, how my child would be and how I would raise my child in a warm, loving, two-parent home. Well, not everything in life goes as planned.
I can't even begin to count all the parents I spoke to over the years who were convinced that the special education staff at their school hated their child. The parents would ask for something that they believed their child desperately needed, but the staff would refuse to do it, or fail to do it.
Those years between 13 and 18 certainly weren't easy, were they? It's amazing that we got through them. Some of us got through them relatively unscathed, while others are still self-conscious about the very issues that we got teased about back then
Moms with postpartum depression cannot wait for care and treatment when faced with depression and other perinatal emotional complications. The impact on both Mom and her infant can be serious. But in Massachusetts there is a new model that is providing hope for these mothers and changing the landscape so that providers can provide the care that is needed.
There's no one pre-fabricated plan (or home) to fit all families, and a child's needs may change over time. But when crises flair or progress slows, reconsidering this solid base helps organize your thoughts and leads to concrete actions to take
\Oh, so this for you, then?\ That's what my neighbor said when I told him a) I was thinking about a Lorax themed birthday party for my almost-3-year-old, and b) she'd probably be happy if the only decor were the three big, white balloons she'd chosen herself that morning.
If I take a deep breath and step back for a moment, though, I can see that these messes are reminders of all that is wonderful in my life. In the evening, when all is quiet and I finally sit down to relax, I look around surveying the chaos that lingers and recall all the mess represents.
It seemed like we started out by shunning those moms that couldn't do it all. The ones who hired someone to sew on the Girl Scout patches, ran the kids through the drive-thru for dinner and bought cupcakes instead of making them. Now we are blasting the moms who are able to go the extra mile and do a little something extra to brighten their kids' day.  Are you kidding me?
Sometimes I get down on the floor and assemble block towers and read books and sing \The Itsy Bitsy Spider\; sometimes I can't be bothered because I'm just so bored with entertaining a baby for 10 hours a day.
Last week, a Montana lawmaker introduced a bill that would outlaw certain types of yoga pants. Here's why that's totally bogus. Written on behalf of every mom-of-young-kids in America.
Change is hard and good policies aren't enough in a culture that doesn't prioritize caregiving. For a glimpse into the challenges of creating a truly family-friendly culture we only need to look to America's largest employer -- the federal government.
I told you how happy I was for you. What an occasion it was. I made excuses to let you go and then I cried. Kate hadn't spoken yet. Hadn't uttered a sound.

In the not-so-distant future (despite your protests), your attentions will turn toward finding your life partners. Since it's Valentine's Day -- and the focus is romantic love -- I want you to be very clear on what romantic love is not:


It made me realize that there's a lot to learn about love, more than paper hearts, candy, and silly marketing, and that there's also a lot to teach my kids. Here's what I want my son to know about love.
I welcome the on-going dialogue about adoption, with hope it can lead to better care and protections for children worldwide. I pray for understanding and grace as we all continue this conversation.



Golden ages are characterized by stability, harmony, prosperity. Is it any surprise I don't want this time to end? Who would?! Let's be golden forever!
The truth of the matter is that my baby has just as much right to be on a plane as any adult. When we are flying, I do my best to keep the chaos to a minimum, but chances are I'm more bothered by my child's crying than the guy across the row from me is.
Lean back, dads. You might be surprised by how comfortable it feels. When a dad spends more time involved with his children, virtually everyone in his life feels better.
I believe passionately that we need to raise our kids in a world where they can thrive and be protected from preventable illnesses that threaten their health and even their lives.
Every parent has said it. My parents said it. My husband's parents said it. I'm pretty sure my great-great-great-grandparents said it, but back then it sounded more like, \If you keep sassin' your pa, I'll turn this buggy around, an whoop your ass down by the crick.
Interactive features like these are really stepping up kids' toys, helping to keep their attention, engage their imaginations, and even help teach kids about programming and technology. Unicorns, robots, and dinosaurs--oh my! This fall, kids are sure to have some crazy new friends ready for playtime. Best of all? You never even have to schedule a playdate.
Remember your kid this Valentine's Day with something special. Of course you're not the love of his or her life, but when t(w)eens feel unloved and unlovable (like Freeze Up Dude and the gang) it's a nice thing to be reminded that Mom or Dad cares.
It felt like I was in a movie -- one of those scenes where the woman in labor screams in pain and squirms as each contraction kicks in. Never had I imagined that giving birth would feel like a thin line between life and death -- both for me and my baby.
I remember the days when I was the oxygen my son could hardly do without. Reunions were dramatic; after being away an hour or two he would leap into my arms before I had barely walked through the door. And then, it changed... as it must.
I still wonder if maybe I missed the call for the \perfect\ baby. I wonder if I am to blame. I then remind myself that it isn't just me, or my son and other mothers feel the same. We just need to know that we are OK.
I am an honest mom... are you? I recently witnessed a horrible soccer match. All the kids on our team were not on their game. My son, who typically lights the field on fire with his dominance and outstanding ability to take control of the ball and score most of the goals... Sucked.
I'll put the kids to bed, Cupid. You just lie there like you do every night, but tonight I'll heat your neck-warmer thing in the microwave and cool your eye mask and even turn off \u00be of the white noises to make it sound 3/4 less like an airport hangar in here.
One beautiful afternoon in Central Park, my husband and I sat and discussed having a child. Today, that child turned five. Though I'm not quite sure how that happened.
When I watch my daughter strut around the playground, I think


Everybody's an expert and nobody knows anything. Nobody has the answers and everybody figures it out. Everybody muddles through. Nobody emerges unscathed. Except maybe our kids. Hopefully our kids.
It appears as though our toddler operates under his own set of rules that not only don't coincide with civilization's, but often undermine society's very core. I am pretty sure that if you have a toddler, you know what I mean.

Whether we like it or not, kids and teens look to celebrities for inspiration on how to look, act, speak, and more. Their inspiring stories, personal triumphs, self-acceptance, and decisions to speak out against the industry's standard of beauty and size has us sitting up and taking notice -- and we hope this is a trend we see more of.
Isn't it time I expected more of myself? I know I'm good enough, but I think I can do better.
When I was 5, it was a different decade, a different era, even a different world. I hear these new-sounding words out of the mouth of my babe, and I appreciate just how far we've come from rotary dialing and meatloaf for dinner.

Touch is one of the first senses to develop while the baby is still in the womb (between 7-8 weeks gestation). From their earliest weeks, babies depend on touch for exploring their world. Touch is so important that some consider skin to be the external nervous system.
As your son's social world expands, you will have increasingly less control over what popular characters he encounters and so it's good to think ahead about how you want to respond to his request for them.
What am I teaching my daughters by not facing my fear? This year, I'm going to get in the pit. I'm going to do it to show my girls that age is a number, but music is timeless.
I often daydream of giving away most of what we own and moving into a Tiny House of some kind, with clever storage everywhere and only the bare essentials surrounding us. \Ooh! Thank you! This is wonderful!\ I imagine them saying.
\Mommy, do you want to dry the dishes?\ my oldest daughter asked. \Not right now,\ I responded, \I'm taking some pictures.\ Stop. The. Bus. Since when did I become more concerned with documenting the experience than being engaged with it?

First off, you look great. You'll look pretty good eight years from now, too, but for the record, right now you look great. I just wanted to let you know a few things before you get started on that whole having a baby, and then having three babies, thing.

Showing our children how to be their own best friends is not necessarily easy, but it's definitely worth teaching by living it ourselves.
Your husband cannot read your mind. He doesn't know that you wanted him to pick up dinner from the Thai restaurant on the corner because you've been pacing the kitchen all afternoon with a fussy baby.
Despite her mother's pleas, Zoe was released from the mental health facility to live with her father. Trinlie waited and prayed for the call that would tell her a treatment bed had opened up for Zoe. But on Aug. 6, 2014, she received a very different kind of call.

I learned that doubles can change everything; when they come, a quiet surge of power elevates she who rolls them. I learned to remember to pick up my dice, to play every game until it was over, and always, always to play the best out of three.
When we let go and stop trying to force our days to bend to our stubborn wills, the moments that make our days worthy of remembering will find us, and if we are willing and ready, they will seize us, enrapturing us in its loving grip.
Where do all the baby socks go? If you're a parent, you can probably relate to this dilemma

With motherhood, I am just making it up as I go along. I fully admit that I don't really have any idea what I am doing. Most of the time, I just wing it and do the best that I can by following my gut. Maybe there is another path, but I haven't found it yet.



\She isn't talking,\ he said. \She won't respond to anything I say.\ There was no color in her face. Her eyes looked clouded and distant.
Breastfeeding is an area ripe for tangled public discourse about sexism and expectation, mother's rights and women's rights, working motherhood and stay-at-home parenting, nutrition and science, convenience and cost, entitlement and class, encouragement and pressure.
can adapt my expectations about my life so that the disappointment and shock of landing in Holland instead of Italy is turned into celebration. I can do that.
From what I've learned, these expensive unpaid internships afford students an opportunity to meet new people, make new friends and acquire new skill sets. Like a job at a fast food restaurant wouldn't also provide those things, along with a paycheck.
This year, I got thrown a curve ball. My daughter found herself in the midst of a social situation that Supermom could not swoop in and fix.
This isn't about getting my kids to eat less, it's about taking the attention away from sweets in a world that does the opposite. Sweets are just another enjoyable food to eat but not the main event. I think dessert with dinner gets that message across loud and clear.
I obviously love my child, but I love being a complete version of me, and sometimes that means looking after myself before I look after him.
I've heard people say we shouldn't let our kids play football at all. I don't think this is the answer.  I know my incredibly smart and talented friend Scott Ross didn't think it was the answer, either.  We need to work together to find a solution.
Sharing this winter wonderland with my child guarantees 24 hours of unbridled wonder and pure, awesome joy. Also, migraines.



I want you to learn another way to feel love in the world. It doesn't just have to come from the people you already have in your life. There are always people in the world who are alone or having a hard time who could use a smile in their day and you have the power to give that to them.
It may be news to many, but every one of our six babies was planned (well, except for the extra twin we didn't anticipate).

The process of planting a seed, watering it every day, watching it sprout and grow a wee bit taller everyday is pleasurable by itself. It's even more enjoyable when you get to use your produce in your daily food.
January 31, the day before the Super Bowl, is National TV Safety Day. It's an important day for parents, grandparents and anyone who has kids in their homes, because checking your TV matters.




My jeans and I aren't going out to bars anymore, as I'm wearing them to playdates and park trips instead. They feel stronger than before -- I'm not so worried about getting them dirty now. Much like myself, I suppose.
It's easy to feel like we, as adults, are the teachers and it is our job to share everything that we know and have learned with the youth of today. It's funny how sometimes, the things we have \learned\ are the same things that hold us back in our lives.
Sometimes, children do things or say things that fall in between our need to be accepting or containing. How should parents respond to these \in-between behaviors\?
Madeline is a binge eater. My teething 10-month-old is nursing half the night. Her preferred position is on her side with me sort of curled around her so that she can sleep/nurse with her hands grabbing my boob and her feet bicycling a mini Tour de France on my belly.
We all want what is best for our children, but the truth is that we are all in this together. Vaccines matter. They save lives. And when they are not given, the impact can be devastating and far-reaching.
My urge, my only urge, is to wrap her up in my long arms and hold on dearly while the quietest storm passes over us -- only I'm pretty sure there is no storm on the horizon at all. This is growing up. This is riding the seesaw between goofy kid and complex young adult.
My daughter is just shy of eight months old, and although she can't talk yet, it sure seems like she has a lot to say.

Yeah, Facebook is annoying. It's overused and overexposed. But, for parents of children who have rare diseases or disorders, special equipment, body differences, or something that makes them extra unique... it's the most precious invention, ever.
But what do you do as a parent when your children enter the ring for a wrestling match over a toy? While it is important that they are given every opportunity to work through the conflict themselves, they do require parental presence and guidance to help keep them safe.
Fathers are, in the words of researchers, \gatekeepers\ of their daughter's ambitions. Father's have to put in the time at home doing chores with their kids, especially daughters. Paying lip service to \equality\ isn't good enough.
In attempting to maintain our status as a superpower, perhaps the United States should come to the realization that a woman does not have to be sick to have a baby.
In reviewing both of these studies, I found it interesting that more grown-ups (parents) are now using social media and yet some are not heeding the advice about online safety that they should be teaching their children, such as oversharing information online.



If our kids can be taught to be kind and compassionate to each other then why can't we as adults be taught to do the very same thing. Show tolerance in the weeks to come. Choose kindness when you see someone in need. And above all else respect those around you.
The best day ever was when I remarried last summer -- my two daughters and my husband's two sons were the entire wedding party. What followed was the anticipation of the best honeymoon ever to Bora Bora! I couldn't believe how euphoric I felt... until I hit \the glitch.\
All kids need exposure to media that's not sexualized, stereotypical or gendered. But apps that are specifically designed to avoid these messages are particularly good for girls because they open new doors that have often been out of reach.
The truth is, she can take or leave my instructions -- they are just words, but she sees everything that I do.
We think we're somehow being good parents if we beat ourselves up for every mistake. As if guilt and hemming and hawing and self-doubt = LOVE. But one of the many problems with this belief is that this critical voice we use to berate ourselves becomes our kids' internal voice, too.




When you play \What if...\ with positive statements, you give yourself an opportunity to nourish yourself in the now.
Flu season has arrived and the sad fact is that no matter how hard you try, sometimes you just can't avoid getting the flu.

I wonder if they see (or will someday see) my lack of a formal career as an expectation of who they should be as adults.
Saving is important. So is being prepared for various horrible things that could maybe happen down the road. But what's the point of saving and scrimping for a possible future when we have a life to live today?
My daughter's analysis of her meager trophy collection made me think. Should we encourage her more? Are the kids with more after-school activities better off? Even though I personally think trophies are cheesy, is there a correlation between awards and self-esteem?
What if we refused to allow January to shame us into feelings of inadequacy? What if we took a cue from toddlers everywhere and turned up our noses at what January was serving us?
This week, I've been thinking about A, the first boy I mentored through Big Brothers Big Sisters. It was his birthday this week, and I try to send him birthday wishes each year, even though I'm no longer his Big Brother.
When added together throughout the days, these little parenting rewards help soften the memory of harder days, terrible tantrums, and outright defiance. Here are a few of my favorite so far...
Real motherhood is not about having the child you pictured in your head or having a child who fulfills the dreams you thought you had. It is an adventure of discovery.
Sometimes it feels like technology is raising -- or rather -- regressing our kids. We can complain all we want about the tsunami of media flooding our children's lives, but are we seriously willing to give in to it?
Like most people, I used to make resolutions and burn out before the end of January. So, I took the pressure off and felt like a slogan would allow me to still feel accomplished because I have the whole year to live out some cool slogan. I could certainly do that!
Raise your hands
I suspect that one day she will slave over her hair, trying to make it straight or curly or wavy -- but for now, its wildness is simply perfect.
I wish we'd never known each other. I wish this was a journey you'd never had to embark on. I'm still new to this journey. We've only been on it for four months. I just want you to know you are strong.
Parenting experts want to help us. They want to foster our self-awareness so we can not only effectively self-regulate during challenging moments with our children, but so we can also cultivate our children's self-awareness so they, too, can effectively self-regulate.
As a parent with a food allergic child, I feel a constant low-grade anxiety about meals. The world is full of culinary land mines, and I try to map a path to navigate around them for my child.
Have you ever re-watched your favorite teen drama only to realize that you now identify more with the PARENTS than with the kids? (Wow, Jim and Cindy Walsh really did have some good advice... Brenda WAS being selfish, Brandon really DID need to loosen up...)



The start of the New Year brings such inspiring energy and motivation to live better and achieve more. At midnight on December 31 we collectively hit the reset button and make commitments to improve ourselves and our lives during the coming 12 months. With all of that positive energy and good intentions why do we fail to stick to our resolutions?
Suddenly, all those years playing defense against the ever-persistent sperm brigade seemed a monumental wasted effort. According to the drawings and descriptions of the complex and interdependent biological processes involved, getting pregnant was nearly impossible.
The bubbles were forgotten. An entire year's worth of small moments missed because I kept putting them off for another day.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with me passing along a compliment to a woman in front of her children, or mine. But I overthought things, and I shouldn't have. Somehow society has convinced me that when I have my daughters, women are off-limits.

So what motivates me as an educator to write about toys?  As teacher of media and tech, I have been interested in ways to teach students computational thinking.  This year was the first time I found a toy that helps do just that.
I mothered. I mothered not my own children, but I mothered nonetheless. I mothered in a way that I am accepting and embracing, but also defining for myself.
A new year. Countless opportunities to get more of what you want in life. Exciting thought, eh? So what do you really want? If you're the parent of a tween or teen, I'm guessing you might want a healthier relationship with your child.
Teaching weekly middle school digital literacy classes, aka \Cyber Civics,\ gives me a unique view into their digital world; a world where they spend more time than they do in school or with their families. I've discovered that they have some strong opinions on resolutions they'd like us to make in 2015.
I am writing this exactly 35 days, 4 hours and 51 minutes into my life as a father. I can attest to the experience being grand and challenging. Incredibly pure joy and intoxicating elation felt for the smallest moments shared, of smiles and stares (and silence). Incredibly trying sleep deprivation creating zombie-like states and hair-trigger moods for my wife and me.

Grace received this letter just days ago. Be ready, because it punches you right in the feels. Amy, a volunteer with National Service Dogs, has been following our story, and she's taken a special interest in little Grace. She understands Grace, you see, in a way, even I can't.
I was once the mother of babies who squirmed to be out of my arms and let down, who then grew into children who would wiggle free of my hands impatient to run in the park, and then zoomed into teens who began taking phones into their rooms to talk privately.
I think a lot of us are unkind to the young women we used to be. Why do we do it? What does it achieve?
Increasingly our world is a wired one. But keeping our children away from screens entirely may never have been the best of ideas.
He forgets to eat. He forgets his homework. He forgets his manners at school when he sings \Happy Birthday, Poo Poo\ in class.  The boys laugh. The teacher calls home. Mommy calls the doctors.
First, I will go ahead and say it, so you don't have to
South Carolina single mom Debra Harrell allowed her daughter to play at a popular park for three days this summer. This was after the girl's laptop was stolen and she didn't want to just sit at mom's job -- McDonald's -- all day. A \Good Samaritan\ saw the girl unsupervised and called 911.
My son is, and has long been, a loser. This simple teenage truth became comically clear about this time last year and remains true to this day. The mystery also remains, \Why can't my son keep track of his things?\
A couple of months before Tamir Rice died with an Airsoft gun in his hand, I stopped my son and a black friend as they were headed out our back door to meet a classmate at the park, loaded down with Nerf guns.
When we were matched with our birth mom and learned she was expecting a boy, we let go of Sophia, the girl's name we had chosen. Although we were very careful not to refer to him by Jacob because of all the things that could still go wrong, I'll admit we began to think of the unborn boy as our son.
We all belong to a tribe or race and some of us belong to many. Our perspectives, racial attitudes and preferences are informed by our experiences and our membership in these groups. We have to do our own work to build bridges and ensure that our children do the same.

The understanding that they can lose me is very real. Belief is the only thing they have. If they only dealt with \reality,\ or what they see, imagine how defeating this would be.

Boys of parents who encourage high standards and moral courage have an easier time thinking independently and standing up for what they believe in. And that can be as simple as being brave yourself
While I'm not saying every little boy should drop their race car in exchange for a princess; I long for the day when Cinderella can hop into a Hot Wheels and drive off into the sunset... and it will be no big deal.


We're going to try a combination of traditions this time
The saying goes \I thought I would have to teach my daughter about the world, turns out I have to teach the world about her.\ This has been true enough in the past four years, but it is also true to add that it turns out that my daughter has had to teach me. So, Merry Christmas, from a very proud and humbled mum, to the best teacher I've ever had.

Over the past month, my husband and I have been thinking about the holiday traditions we'd like our little family to have. What will our daughter grow up to remember and be comforted by?
When I look back on 2014, it will be hard not to view it as a year of loss. But my family found some positive things, too.
With just a few days left before Christmas, you might find yourself wondering \How did I wait this long to get my shopping done?\ While year after year we vow to start our gift hunt early, we always manage to find ourselves scouring for parking spots at the mall just a few days before Santa makes his way to our rooftops. But don't worry -- you're not alone.
In today's world, children are bombarded with the promise of happiness if they can just get the right toys, clothes, gadgets and gizmos. It's not easy to neutralize those messages, even if we deliver heartfelt lectures about how there's more to life than \stuff.\
As soon as they go to sleep, you sit with your iPhone looking at pictures of said baby, because you miss him or her already.
Those seven Amazon boxes are really just full of stuffed animals. Is it already 11:00 p.m.? Thank God this won't take long. I see us asleep by midnight. Maybe most of them come assembled. I got this.

December 25, 1996. Or, as I call it, the Most. Awkward. Christmas. Ever.

For years, Elmo was a furry guy who existed only on T-shirts. When you finally saw him walk and talk, you practically sh*t yourself.
Because he wants the magic, he'll believe. But then that questioning, growing-up voice will persist. \But what do YOU believe?\
My parents used to just tell me that Santa was watching, and I'd look at the celling, and assume there was some ominous eye viewing my behavior. Things are much more tangible now.



Planning for success is all about perspective
There was no such thing as a varicella vaccine when I was growing up. Getting the chicken pox was a fact of life, a rite of passage for everyone. Except for me.
Whether you are looking for items for your own baby or gifts for the new expectant parents on your list, think long-term.
I certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to be encouraged to further my career if I felt I could do so and successfully rear children as well. As we move forward, companies like Talking Talent may help provide creative solutions and support so that women don't feel forced to choose between two things they love.
I have great memories of my thirteenth birthday. I received some great gifts and even made a special wish that night (which did come true!).  So, in honor of my sweet 13-year-old, here are my wishes for her.
Like most children, my 5-year-old is obsessed with Christmas. He loves the brightly colored lights. He is spellbound by Christmas trees. He gleefully sings about reindeers, Santa, and jingle bells. The only problem is that we're Jewish and we don't celebrate Christmas.
In this new world where we all give as well as receive soundbites, a noteworthy name packs more power than ever before.

My daughter taught me that she is not me and her way of doing things is not my way. \Different\ doesn't necessarily require fixing.


As I was walking to the door thinking I had successfully avoided waking anyone up, I heard a whisper in the dark say, \Dad, where are you going?\ It was my son walking towards me in his jammies with crazy bedhead.
In the midst of the \happiest place on earth,\ I came to a realization that made me decidedly unhappy. My daughter and I were two very different people.
The year of dates was a practice in discipline. That might sound unromantic, but I'm learning that when you have small children constantly vying for your attention, sometimes you have to practice discipline to create the space for romance.
How many times has a mom or dad told a kid who stops to play with a new toy to \put it down because there are more presents to open?\ Or the minute gifts are opened, swept wrapping paper into garbage bags and asked the kids to get their presents up to their rooms before family comes?

We met at 15, started dating seriously at 19, got married at 27 and have been married for over 15 years. We know each other. Well. Still, I'm starting to wonder if I'm okay with the fact that the majority of our time together is spent doing our own thing.
I think we must figure out how we can we give ourselves, and others, permission to mourn their should have beens. Can we give ourselves, and others, permission to feel it all -- the blessings, the lucky, the anger, the sadness, the guilt, and even, the shame?
My Christmas wish for this next year is to accept the end of babyhood and try to let go. Try to let this little human being have a bit of autonomy. Believe me, it will not come naturally. But it has to come. Because she is not just an extension of me.
\Happy Holidays!\ \Happy Hanukkah!\ Even in our greetings, this time of year come with a lot of expectations. For many families, the \happy\ and \merry\ expectations can cause great stress and anxiety -- not just for you as an adult, but for your children, too.
Changing work culture, especially for high-earning women, means recognizing the value of caregiving and work-life balance. For women in hourly, low-wage work, it means changing cultures that see them as replaceable and also irresponsible when caregiving clashes with unpredictable schedules.
Babies are showered with presents, love and joy before they are even born, so what obligation do we have to make sure they have more presents on Christmas morning?
As much as I sometimes want to, we don't pin a sign to Mareto's shirt explaining his autism. So other people, particularly strangers, give us a lot of attention in the form of staring, dirty looks, snide under-the-breath comments and just overall judgment.
There are gifts and there are gifts. Typically the ones we exchange during the holidays are perfectly fine. (Anyone wants to send me chocolate, you've got my email.) But face it, despite the stressing about what to get and how much to spend, most of what we give and get is just not that memorable.
It hurts. It just hurts. You suppress your feelings as much as you can because you fear if you really let it out, you would never recover. And here's the thing -- you didn't have to be that mom. For all the moms and dads reading this now -- this doesn't have to be you.
I like to take photos of things that may be a bit out of the ordinary

Our kids still get a few toys -- we're not Scrooges -- but we also incorporate experiential gifts, and we ask family members to contribute. Here are six ideas that will make your kids light up.

People who are exceptionally intelligent in one or more areas can be particularly difficult to choose gifts for, either because their interests are so esoteric (e.g., physics) or so focused that you are inclined to expand their horizons (e.g., no more puzzles, no more comics!).

Six years ago unbeknownst, hell unplanned by me I'd just gotten knocked up with T. Of all the thousands of lessons I've learned from parenting in the last six years, perhaps the weirdest has been sometimes it is a relief to find out that another kid puked a little in your kid's hair.
While you will face people who wish you harm for the passport you hold, the religion you follow or the color of your skin, you will also know many people who wish you nothing but happiness and success. It turns out, there is a dark side and a light side to humanity, and the battle is raging.
We intuitively know that the first years of life are critical. But why are they so important? In short, a baby's brain is simply exploding with possibility and buzzing with activity.

Becoming a parent has done something wicked to me. Instead of waiting for the future, I sometimes find myself trapped in the past.
I love my stretch marks, because they are a constant reminder of who I am. But they are only a part of what defines me. I am so much more than a mom. I am a woman, a daughter, a sister, a friend, a wife, a thinker, a writer, a deep feeler, a dreamer, a doer.
My carefree life had already been obliterated with the birth of our first child. We'd barely notice the addition of a mere 8 to 10 pounds' worth of additional human in our household. This was what I told myself, along with a few other handy lies...
\I work from home\ provides no information. \Nothing,\ while tempting, belies the truth. \I work for my husband,\ makes me feel like I've set the feminist movement back 60 years and I'm riding shotgun with Betty Draper.

While the gifts you buy may sparkle under the tree, they are not necessarily the ones that have the greatest impact or the deepest meaning.
Just like any other mum (working or not working), I get stressed, feel overwhelmed, things sometimes do slip through the cracks and at times I barely meet deadlines (school projects, papers, registration, paperwork, etc.).
\The Big Book of Parenting Tweets\ is a new collection of 300 Tweets from funny people on Twitter who also happen to be parents, curated by Kate Hall, creator of the popular Hall of Tweets blog. It's hilarious.
How do we keep going without losing our peace, our sanity and rolled eyeballs into the northernmost parts of our brains? How do we keep perspective and gratitude and love foremost in our minds and hearts rather than resorting to pain and shouting?

All I want is peace and for the game to end before I'm old enough to sprout hairs out of the moles on my face. As I pack up the evil pieces, eye still twitching, I somehow keep it together and say, \That was fun,\ and wonder if anyone believes me.
You have somehow transported yourself into a different dimension where everyone talks about themselves in the third person, as in, \Mama needs some time to herself, like, for real...\
Many years ago, while still full of life, my boobs raised eyebrows. Now they are flat like pancakes. If only they were still round like pancakes.
Your kids, your nieces and nephews are paying attention when you think they're not. They learn how to interact with their siblings and cousins by watching the adults at family gatherings
I remember telling my mom I hated her when I was a teenager. I am sure it hurt her more then she let on, because if my son tells me that one day, I would be devastated.  I will probably call her and tell her all about it. Because she will understand.
It is easy to teach a child that stealing other people's pencils, crayons -- \stuff\ -- is unacceptable and, more importantly punishable. But in the online world, the idea of stealing becomes murky.

While Young's case is currently experiencing a fever pitch of visibility, her story is far from an anomaly.
When someone we love is robbed from us, it feels like the world should stop. Actually, it does. For a moment. And we look around us, jealous that others are still living, working and being alive.
I found the Parental Stress Hotline number and finally had someone to talk to at 4:00 a.m. about noisy birds. I eventually found numbers for the Hadley-based group MotherWoman and MOMS Club in East Longmeadow, not to mention the number of a psychiatrist who prescribed me wonderful, wonderful drugs. The more I talked, the better I became.
I pulled out the list and began to make my way through it, finding that some names were easy to add to the delete columns, while others were a little harder, but still necessary. But then the unexpected happened.

The holiday season still makes me feel a little left out. It will always bring me back to the days when I was jealous of my friends who got to decorate trees, hang Christmas lights and joyously sing Christmas carols.
I really don't remember doing any chores as a kid... ever. And while I think there is some value in letting kids be kids, I also think doing chores as a child makes adjusting to doing them as an adult much easier.
Don't get me wrong; I LOVE the holidays. It's a wonderful time of year. I just wish I had some elves to help me get it all done.
As we talked, a large family entered the puppy store, their eyes wide with excitement and anticipation. If we'd stayed, chances are good we would have seen them leave with two things
What we seem to be forgetting is that without struggle, there can be no progress. Without embarrassment, there can be no empathy. Without failure, there can be no success.
Mantras have the power to disconnect you from the disarray and the chaos and tap you into the beauty and the possibility of the here and now, before judgement and before thinking.
A common conversation around the house regarding baby


Because breasts are normal. Because using breasts for breastfeeding is normal. Because stretch marks are normal. Because body fat is normal. Because lines are normal.



How did I not notice that you needed compliments and thank-you's just as much as we did? Every mom deserves to hear that she's appreciated, and I'm sorry it took me until now to say that.
I stopped asking him to because it seemed more important to him not to call me mommy than it was for me to hear it.
Yesterday I realized something. Something big. It's this
As shocking as it may be to some, there exists a whole population of families for whom Santa does not wrap his gifts. Don't believe me? Start asking around.
As parents, we want our children to go into the world of school, peers and friendships, and life feeling happy, confident and valued. We do our best to fortify their self-confidence within the home so that they are equipped to be strong and successful in the rest of the world.
Thank you for your realism that this doesn't always work. Without even knowing it, you had my back in that interview. Thank you for supporting what needs to be the message.

You see, I felt like bowing down to that belly. I felt like celebrating it and thanking it for what it had carried -- for whom it had carried.


1. A partner who's really into cooking the turkey (this is not a euphemism).
In July 2002, I woke up doubled over in pain. I couldn't eat, I couldn't drink, and I could barely breathe. I went to my doctor and she immediately did an ultrasound on my kidneys and liver. She was certain I had a kidney infection. Four days later, the doctor called and said, \Congratulations! You're 22 weeks pregnant. Please come in for a consult as soon as possible. Goodbye.\
Thanksgiving. You can't avoid it. It's coming. Tomorrow. And whether you love it or hate it, whether it brings together people you love or people you loathe, there's one thing that rings true for all. It could possibly be the culmination of an entire year's worth of chaos at one dinner table.
I am making progress -- I am yelling less and loving more -- and that is what matters to me more than perfection.


With little children, it is obvious that we need to act as their prefrontal cortex because we know that they aren't capable of inhibiting their impulses. We keep them close when we're near the street and make sure not to leave sweets sitting around where they will have trouble resisting them.
We are creating a generation of kids who are folding under the pressure. After all, by definition, most people who take part in competitions lose. As the testing starts earlier, this also makes for divided classrooms. Children who don't do well right away tend to write themselves off early on.

Sun City has no idea what's coming, but they better amp up their WiFi, add tattoo artist to their spas and start training their DJs.
They say that a crisis really shows you who your friends are. I don't subscribe to many things that \they\ say, but this one, yes.
I'm sitting here thinking about how grateful I am for giving natural birth to my set of boy/girl twins. On the other hand, let's get real for all the not-so-grateful moments in new parenthood.
\See, the Tooth Fairy has to have another job to support this tooth habit of hers. Wednesdays are the day that she works as a spy for the government.  Because she's so small she can do lots of really important jobs that normal humans can't, and they pay her very well.\
Mom wrote about sitting at the edge of el Rio Cangrejal in Honduras while her Abuelita Tinita slapped their clothes against the rocks. She wrote about when she stole the gallina when she was 10 because she wanted a soup so bad, she didn't think beyond her hunger.
I thought I'd be leading a company, but here I am leading with my belly.  At home. With two kids. My mom -- the epitome of tenacious -- often says, \Go with what you're given.\
To every nurse out there that dedicates their hard work to their patients and profession, THANK YOU.  When you're exhausted, and you don't know how much longer you can do the work you do, remember that beauty is all around us
Sammy is her own young woman. She knows who she is. She knows what she wants. She is only 12, and we have lots of decisions to make about hormones, etc. -- but in the end, we need to follow her lead. Like any woman, she will define who she is. And I couldn't be more proud.

This holiday season, the tech-driven toy industry is balanced out with a variety of toys that encourage kids to create wonderful stories, pretend to be someone new, or practice what they'd like to be what they grow up. Here are some great new items on the shelves to get your kids' imaginations started.
I have represented mothers of infants who do not want to be always available to them, who want time away, who want the fathers to share the burden as well as the joy. And if those parents are happier with that arrangement, doesn't that benefit their babies?
Thanksgiving is a meaningful time for many families across the country. It's a time to reflect on, and to give thanks for, life's bountiful gifts. Along with empathy, understanding the importance of expressing gratitude is something that you can actually teach your child, and Thanksgiving is a wonderful time to start.
Lately, I have been overwhelmed by the stubborn impenitence of serious disease. How it seems to strike friends and family powerfully and at random. Lives are forever changed. That could have happened to our family today. For some reason, we were spared. For that, I was thankful.

When you think of the technology that's at our fingertips today, it seems Santa could really come through with a few items that would be helpful not only to me, but to mothers everywhere.
Some of these men stay at home, and some share the child-rearing load with their partners; but the most important factor is that more dads are understanding that childcare is difficult, important, and not only for moms.
You know what kids? Love yourselves like Willow and Jaden love Willow and Jaden. You deserve it. You deserve all the insanity and enthusiasm and inspiration of youth. Life will get complicated and soon enough you'll have to pay for your own car insurance.
When it comes to holidays and birthdays, it's not about buying more, it's about buying smart.
As a parent, I wish I could make all the opinionated people on the bus and other public spaces just be quiet and keep their opinions to themselves. But I can't. They and their ridiculous ideas will always be there for my daughter and everyone else to unwillingly hear.

Women have been suffering alone. For mothers, there is so much shame and stigma attached to a prenatal or postpartum struggle. It's the big secret -- the elephant in the room.
I've been judged for sending my daughter to daycare since she was 3 months old; accused of being shallow for not wanting to conform and live a more modest life with just one salary; and even told, \I'm so sorry you can't have more kids, because there's no way you can handle it.\
During her pregnancy, Patricia Young's health care provider considered the question of whether she should lift heavy boxes and said no. Young asked UPS for an alternative assignment until after she gave birth, and they turned her down. (The company has since changed its policy.)

I am proud to say that I am the perfect mother. I have a perfect husband who is likewise, a perfect father. We have a perfect marriage. So naturally, we have perfect children and a perfect family. Before you pass a quick judgement on me, let me explain further.
It's been four months. Four months of sleeping in a sleeping bag on the living room floor. My wife right next to me, on the cushions off the sofa. Our son has our bedroom. All of it. He's 13 months old.





One of the things I most feared prior to motherhood, and one of the things that most annoys me about it now that I actually have children, is the way women with children are reduced to \mommies\ and mommies alone, not allowed or not able to have an identity outside of their relationship to their children.


The perinatologist thought my baby would survive better outside the womb than inside my body. Then he\u00a0asked when I had last eaten.
I always knew he was a great guy -- I probably wouldn't have married him if he wasn't. I did not, however, know the depths of my husband's patience.
I am attached to my children. My desire for my children to be well, happy and peaceful will not waiver. I felt the strength of this commitment especially last summer, when my oldest daughter sustained a head injury.
I fought futilely against my own body so that giving birth to my only child would not be the thing that killed her.


As adults, we usually don't give ourselves permission to process and express our emotions. But we really need to -- not necessarily in the middle of Target, but as soon as possible.
Those childhood feelings of participating in mandatory traditions that did not feel right still sting during the holidays. I think that is why I am so passionate about making chocolate chip cookies for my kids at Thanksgiving. Baking those cookies is my way of saying, \I love you. I see you.\
It is unnatural for a childhood to be robbed of its freedom by worry and disease. But only strict vigilance and avoidance of allergens can protect a child like mine, and with this come many restrictions.
My son is only four, but with the speed at which children grow up these days, it won't be long before he starts going on dates. So I thought I'd write a little something to anyone who is considering going to the drive-in and the ice cream stand -- or maybe the roller rink and soda shop? I'm out of touch -- with my son.
When I became a mom, I knew my life would change. There would be diapers, sleepless nights and booties -- and I am one of those weirdos who actually enjoyed most of it. But what I did not realize was that I would never again use the bathroom alone.

Armed with the skills and confidence, I found nursing more natural (and fun) the second time around. Did I ever get to rockstar \second freezer\ status? No. But I sure worked hard at it. Do I regret anything? No way. Each baby was different, each experience beautiful.
Orchid children are fragile like the flower. They need lots of TLC from parents or caregivers if they are to blossom. But if and when they do flower, so the traditional belief goes, it is something to behold.
Yes, rage has a place. I now have mace on my key chain and attached to the stroller. I hope I don't have to use it. But the mace isn't the point. The point is that I need to give my children and myself something better than rage.

Why is it OK to be openly clueless\as a parent, but not openly confident? Is it all a backlash against Tiger Moms and Helicopter Parents? Whatever the case, it seems that it is not acceptable to openly strive for competence in the most important role that we will ever have.
I don't know how to go about my day without her. I don't know how to think about what I want to do, not what I need to do for her.
I'm not saying you definitely shouldn't have a daily slap-and-tickle session with your partner. I don't know you. Why would I give you that kind of advice? This is probably a conversation you should have with the person you plan on slapping and tickling.
It took us long time to get pregnant with Molly. Not a long, long time, but long enough. Long enough to start to get used to the knot in my stomach every month as I counted the days and the symptoms, trying not to convince myself that every little twinge of nausea was a good sign.


When Joel McHale and his team at The Soup took a major stab at her parenting skills, it was impossible for me to stay tight-lipped. Here's how it all went down.
I'm not a young man. I have 20 years of experience, education and hard knocks behind me. I paid my dues and now my kids will benefit because I'll be able to spend more time with them, instead of hitting the salt mines every day to make ends meet.

This tug of war that is trust versus truth takes place at the intersection of independence and responsibility, through which pass such important issues as underage drinking, other drug use and impaired and distracted driving, among others.
I realized today that I am the personal assistant to a diva celebrity, without any of the implied benefits.
Enjoy the moments with your children. Try not to take things too seriously. Remember that things can change in an instant.
Gratitude is a key element in defining a person that \other people like to be around,\ and November is a wonderful month for laying of that gratitude groundwork. In two weeks most of us will get to look around a table and give thanks for the miracle that got us all here.
In those first few weeks of her life, along with relief and wonder at her progress, I felt a nagging sense of failure. I didn't know what I had done wrong, but I must have botched something.

The long-term benefits this practice gave me are those that I'm not sure my parents would have expected. Not only did it instill a love of writing, which makes sense, but it did a few other amazing things, too.
I love the way she coos, and the way she smiles a goofy, mouth-wide open grin. In five days, I will be handing her over to a team of pediatric surgeons. They will cut open her chest and, provided all goes well, they will repair her heart.
Medically, the first hospital did everything right. I am grateful for that. The surgeon who removed my son's tumor was one of the best pediatric neurosurgeons in the U.S. The nurses on the oncology floor did their job well. But I was miserable.
I've gotten used to the hypocrisy I know I possess as a parent. It's become a necessary evil. I am a normal, albeit flawed human, and \do as I say, not as I do\ is always in the back of my mind.

If we continue to push these kinds of messages -- specifically, the message that dad is less than mom -- and just write them off as jokes, then we as a society are doing a major disservice to our young sons.
It was time for me to tell my son the story behind the little red poppies. I turned off the soccer match and explained to my son why the poppy has long been associated with the Armistice and honoring veterans.
It's going to take more than arts and crafts to fix funding education in America.  But the constant barrage of fundraisers isn't fixing the problem either.
It is fascinating to me to contemplate how uncreative so many of these comments are. The scary part is that they are so commonplace that they really do frame our collective experience of parenting.
I want my son to enjoy watching the game. But only watching it. Because I don't plan to let him play. As the evidence of football's health risks grows, is there any parent left that will?

Having a toddler is like having a permanent voyeur living in your house. They see and hear everything. Except of course, the things you want them to see and hear. I still have to show Harrison how to put his underwear on right side front every day.
My silence was deafening, to me at least. Do my girls have a dad who won't stand up to crap like that from archaic people who still believe a girl's chief purpose in life is to make themselves \cute\ for boys?


Holy Flow parenting for me has been about making a conscious decision every morning to embrace and enjoy these moments while the kids are under this roof with me. I don't want to just survive this phase of our lives, I want to be fully present and enjoy it!
I am a mom, and I am a survivor of childhood \ufeffsexual abuse. Once being a survivor started to interfere with my ability to be a \normal\ mom, I started paying more attention to how and why the two identities were connected.
I wondered if I would lay claim to those words -- not just string them together, but lay claim to their meaning. Lay claim not just to my daughter, but to her extra chromosome. Because cognitive disability was hard for me. Very, very hard.
Thanks to Pinterest, I have been able to identify the top 12 ways I am completely failing as a parent. As a public service, I will share them with you here.
I have allowed my daughter to go on dates with him as long as she checks in with me so I know their whereabouts and that she gets home by curfew. I've asked my daughter what she means when she says she is in love and she just says that she really really is crazy about this boy
My kids are eating all of their Halloween candy right now. Don't worry -- it's not like that. As we all know, however, trick-or-treating produces a Candy Situation.  My kids aren't strangers to treats, but the onslaught of Kid Crack was overwhelming to me. So somehow, in a moment of divine grace, I thought up The Great Switcheroo.
When the sugar crash hits, whether the kid falls to the sidewalk in a full-on tantrum, or merely falls asleep with his face in a pile of Milk Duds, it's all right.  The kids are not evil; the parents are not ineffectual. It's Halloween. Despite how scary things may look, no real harm has been done.
Little Sam was born and I hardly had time to breathe, or sleep, or eat, let alone take walks. I hired a babysitter a couple of hours a week, and when I didn't use the time to collapse on my bed, I scrounged up the leashes.
Having children forced me to slow down, to let go of concerns about order and deadlines and status. I was forced to accept my own limitations, and accepting those limitations ultimately led to letting go of control. Accepting my own limitations ultimately led me to learn how to love.

I have two sons. Two happy, healthy, bright, beautiful sons. And nearly every day someone asks me if I'm going to try for a girl. It is such a rude, wrong, offensive, presumptuous and mean question. So, stop it.
It's possible Ameerah and I will welcome our babies into this world on the same day. We don't know each other, but we might experience life's greatest miracle together, albeit a world apart.
She was the cutest baby that had ever been conceived and produced by anyone, in the history of mankind. My husband said, \I'm getting the car.\ He didn't need to say what I already knew; this child needed to be shown off. The Universe demanded it.
My husband and I can't help but wonder if we're doing the right thing. Given the normal course and degenerative nature of Sanfilippo Syndrome, now is Eliza's best time to actually be able to do things out in the world. With our decision to not go out, we are taking those experiences away.
Young children are innately creative when given the opportunity. But even in early education, we see the effects of developmentally inappropriate expectations that often accompany the high-stakes education culture that has invaded our kindergartens and preschools.
Family time, as it is for many people, used to be limited to nights and weekends. We now get tons of time together, but our days like this are quite literally numbered. Each new day is a step backwards for my daughter.
All the kids swing. All the kids slide. All the kids run and play. But only one of them is constantly falling down and, it turns out, she's starting to notice it too.
Guess what? I am one of those \poor\ parents who takes their children trick-or-treating in \rich\ neighborhoods. I've done it for years, and I'll be doing it again this Friday.
They do this, kids. They start out making you weak at the knees with the love you feel for them -- their tiny little fingers and sweet-smelling heads -- and then push you to the brink of homicide after a few short years of  incessantly asking, \Why?\ and \Why not?\

It's not that I don't whole-heartedly believe those statements, and I am sure before I know it, I'll have a teenager in high school, but the first thought that came to my mind was, cherishing every moment is hard.
I grew up in a household where sex was not discussed. I learned everything I know about sex on the mean streets of Dry Ridge, Kentucky. I wanted it to be different for my children. My son, however, did not.
Never could I have imagined I would find myself, my home and my destined chosen family all from a woman I met online.
My love and devotion to candy corn runs long and deep, so it's always so confusing to me when I see it high on those \worst candies to get on Halloween\ lists.
I ruined my oldest son's experiences with Halloween. I regret that. But maybe by sharing my story, I can help you to not ruin your child's experience.
I have learned to always, always, always have a snack with me. I have found that we can only love each other and talk in normal-pitched voices when we aren't starving, raving lunatics.
Having a baby is probably the most amazing thing most of us can do during our lives. We are creating a whole new person. And yet, the terminology surrounding this magic would be better suited for describing laying tile or any other number of mundane processes.
Looking back 27 years later, I marvel at how little it took to raise a child in a Nepali village in the late '80s and early '90s. Most raised their children the way people have been doing for centuries, with abundant love and not too many things.
For any nurse out there -- whether you're the nurse that loves to take care of the mother, or the nurse that really loves taking care of those babies (the good ones, and ones that like a little drama!) remember what we are all working for. We all want healthy moms, we all want healthy babies, and our patients need someone to fight for this.
It is a sad reality that these drills are part of the world we live in. I will never understand how someone could feel so alone, desperate and be that deranged as to shoot kids. But it happens.
The sun shines bright on the sidewalk, Your bike's in the garage, cast aside, While you sit, transfixed to an iPod, Please -- get your butt outside.
Not to sound like an old fart, but what happened to making your own Halloween costumes? You know, getting all cute with a few friends and wrapping poster board in various colors to become a box of Crayola crayons or a six pack of Coca Cola?

As mommy to young kids, there were so many particulars that needed tending to simply get through a day responsibly and with the least amount of tantrums -- \Not the blue bowl!!! The red!\ But now that we're a bit older, a lot of these peculiarities have faded away.
This Tower of (breastfeeding) Babble has reached a fever pitch. It's time for it to come down. Pick up your axe and start chopping. And next time someone asks, simply tell them, \You don't need to know why I don't breastfeed. Because it shouldn't matter.\
\Tournament.\ Where you can make major parenting mistakes, learn a lot about yourself, and get an opportunity for a real life lesson.

Today, my 5-year-old daughter informed me she has a boyfriend and that this hooligan (my words, not hers) is you. Before you try to tell me you didn't know that you were her boyfriend, you can rest assured that I presumed that to be the case. Nobody would be so foolish as to court my daughter without asking for my permission first, right?

What 4-and-a-half-year-old girl wouldn't want to spend a day with Elsa from Frozen? Certainly not Ariel Shipp of Jacksonville, Florida. And luckily for her she had the opportunity to do just that last month, though Elsa bore a startling resemblance to her mother, Amy.
Sometimes he screams that we're not his family because, biologically, we're not. Adoption can be harder than most people know. Sometimes our little boy truly believes he hates us and he wants his \real\ mommy back, even though he never really knew her.
I have a little boy... A little boy who likes to wear tutus. A little boy who likes to dance.  A little boy who loves to paint and a little boy who hums happy tunes all day long.
Where babies live largely influences what babies eat. Barriers to fresh food means barriers to first food. This matters because what we eat as infants and toddlers sets the stage for later health outcomes, including heart disease, obesity and cancer.
The times that are most challenging for us as parents -- the times when we must discipline our kids -- are the times we have the greatest ability to support and shape a child's growing brain.
There is a petition sweeping the Internet asking Disney to incorporate a protagonist with Down syndrome, but there is a backlash brewing even within the special needs community asking, is it necessary?

The problem facing most Americans is not the Ebola virus, it's our anxiety about the Ebola virus.
Dear Normal, You're fickle, aren't you?  Ever since Kate's diagnosis, I can't really find you. I see snippets of you here and there.


Ebola is a very scary virus and we do need to educate our children on how to stay safe and be aware of their actions. However, what we DO NOT need to do is talk around or to our children about our frustrations, fears and conspiracy theories regarding our personal beliefs.
My husband had a vasectomy. Since we never planned on having kids in the first place, and now we had two children born 355 days apart, it seemed appropriate. It was the right thing, and the best thing, to do for us, our family and my uterus. What I hadn't planned for was \the void.\
Growing concern (and evidence) finds accidental ingestion of pot among children, often in the form of edibles, is also accelerating. In social channels I've heard some argue that marijuana legalization is to be thought of like alcohol but the packaging and delivery of the drug really are far different.
Even as we all know that there are many stumbles along the way to emotional intelligence and wisdom (the journey to developing emotional intelligence is a long and windy one), it is so helpful to get a fuller sense of what is possible and what emotional health looks like in action.
eens learn to negotiate their feelings and relationships while they are still young and under your roof. As we all know, relationships and healthy dating take a lot of practice and trial and error.
It would be awfully nice if Grandma didn't have to ask for a towel before she dared sit down on a seat, and if I didn't have to worry about burning my legs on the exposed seat-warmer wires. But then I think about all of the things I would have to give up if I got a new car.


Go ahead, hop over to Forbes.com and tell me how many pictures you find of influential women wearing a 1\u2033 inseam.
Technology is not going away, so it's our job to use it wisely, and, by doing so, teach our children how to use it wisely.
One day, I hope to get this delicate balance figured out. How to spread my attention between both kids so that I can applaud the efforts of a home run while simultaneously coaxing the other child away from that over-eager dog at a nearby tree.
Be present without any agenda or storyline. Tune in. Be curious about them, what they are saying to you. Notice how happy they are to move on with their day once you have met their need to be heard and seen by you.
Internet, the global system of interconnected computer networks that was created to defend geographic boundaries, has now morphed into a system that transcends the very same boundaries
There is a balance somewhere that allows for peace of mind of the parent on one side and the freedom to explore and express on the part of the wild child on the other. I have yet to find that balance.
Much has been said about the Myth of the Supermom. That nonexistent female who does it all and looks good doing it. As moms, we hear about this woman, we know she's a myth, and yet we wonder... does she really exist?

I could not say it out loud because then it would be real and then my baby would be dead. The promise of our baby would be broken. Life would be different. I would be different. It would all be less. I would never get to hold my baby in my arms because my baby was gone.
Many of the feelings I experienced soon after our loss were expected

lenty of people in the city have dogs, and traveling doesn't impact the ability to take care of a dog. There is a point about the right age for a dog, but I have found four convincing reasons why my son should have a dog.
Postpartum depression is deserving of attention and action from multiple communities, including the feminist community. We need to raise our voices to increase public awareness of the issue, so that women do not feel stigmatized, and demand availability and access to support services.
Since math and money are so inextricably tied, it's possible that you're transmitting anxieties about both, leaving your daughter less confident to handle personal finance decisions

Our culture is vigilant about documenting faces with photographs before they grow and change. But their voices? Those seem to disappear into time and history like a curling spiral of smoke rising up into the sky. Just like that -- poof -- and the voices are gone.

Some people want to just do their thing like they did a decade ago, before blogs, before Facebook, before social media. Others want to use the newfound power of their pulpit, and share, brag, boast, preach their ideologies to the world. The latter can become exhausting for the former, eventually they lash out in frustration, and cease fire gets broken again.
Are you fed up trying to predict whether that nutritious, carefully prepared meal will end up inside your toddler's stomach or tossed gleefully back in your face? Fear not, moms and dads. I've worked it all out for you in this handy flow chart.

The addition of technology to the mix, however, instantly changed that sleepover from a night young girls could remember fondly to an evening that Hailey would forever regret.
For your physical and mental health, it's always best to associate your children as the antidote to weight gain and not the reason. So with that in mind, consider this 5-step five step plan babies and toddlers use to help you lose the parenting pound, or at least keep it down to a pound.

I started treating him like my buddy rather than a nuisance. I gave him the responsibility that he deserved, was capable of and wanted. I stopped pushing him to the side in the chaos of everyday life and slowed down to spend time with him.
In the months following my son's death, yoga enabled a pathway for me to experience myself in my body again. In a rich and saffron-hued yoga studio, lit in the evening with candles, I learned to stay in a moment even as I yearned to escape it.
Parenting with limits is tremendously hard. I have always known this because I have practiced this type of parenting since my daughters were young. However, nothing prepared me for how hard it would be in the teen years.

Start padding those resumes, just like you do to your own, and you're going to be rocking that \Proud Parent to an Honor Roll Student\ bumper sticker in no time.
I have written before about my frustration with the marginalization of parents in the autism arena.  There is judgment abound among the public and even within the community itself. The way I see it, we are placed, by our own hand and others, into one of a few, superficial categories.

Clothed in jammies and our plastic masks, we'd fall down in front of the TV, dump our night's treasure on the floor and divide it up by good, yucky and OK, stuffing as much as we could into our mouths during the process.
Confidence can be a rare commodity most particularly for mothers, especially when there's always someone out there critiquing parenting performance. Thankfully, confidence, like parenting, can be learned.
It's taken 30+ years of life, marriage and two kids to really understand what my parents have done -- and are still doing -- for me. Here are a few of the decisions, actions and sacrifices they made that I only comprehended after becoming a parent myself.

Parenting can be so hard. Thankfully, the good times outweigh the trying ones, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a constantly changing, 24/7 job.

Babywearing helps us keep up with chores, work and life. 2014-10-07-DSC_8355.jpgWe can do almost anything while wearing our babies -- write, cook, work, walk -- anything that can be safely done with a baby on our chest or back.
I'm not a hero, I'm just efficient and not so scared of hospitals. And someone said that a hero \ain't nothing but a sandwich,\ which really just makes me hungry.

As parents, I think we need to discover an erotic world in our house that remains separate from the children. The girls have no trouble entering their imaginary realms -- any place, any time of day.
There are several things I wish total strangers would quit saying. And from my conversations with other moms, I'm not the only one who hears them.
It's clear that there are driving forces behind both Lego's rise and Barbie's decline in sales
The other day, I was walking through the grocery store parking lot with all three of my kids. Because I was distracted by the usual chaos of reminding everyone to hold hands, look for cars and get their fingers out of their noses, I was surprised to hear a voice behind me.
I aim to connect with people through sharing stories. But where do my rights as a parent end and my children's rights as digital citizens begin? In a huge gray area of unknown, that is where.
Yes, there is something known as \good\ stress. And research shows that making people aware of good stress is a more powerful antidote to its ills than jarring them with statistics.
When I think of the term withdrawals, my mind immediately goes to drugs, alcohol or prescription medicine abuse. My mind does not think of a happy, innocent toddler.
Before boys enter the equation, there is hope. Second and third grade is not too soon to talk to girls about how to respect themselves and others.

Beau was eager to introduce Theo to his new baby sister. It was adorable and hilarious and completely sweet watching Beau burst with pride and Theo cock his head to the side in curiosity over the baby.
Personally, I've always thought the whole point of school pictures is to provide an authentic representation of childhood -- to record every shift of the dental landscape, document every boo-boo, remind us of an unrequited love affair with bangs.
New studies on the effects that playing games has on kids indicate positive benefits for learning, thinking, social-emotional skills building, and, yes, even school performance.
The business has taught me so much about life and parenting and it was always a step ahead of my kids so I could apply these business lessons to parenting.
Children are not sexual. Exposed skin is not sexual. Children with exposed skin are not sexual. Children are children.
For the first time ever, my son had ordered his own meal and was understood. As the three of us sat at the table basking in his moment, I noticed my son's attention was drawn to the table behind us. First, he was smiling and then he wasn't. He was frowning.
When the Thanksgiving dinner dishes were being cleared, I asked Bailey if he had time for a chat, and we walked into another room. He seemed open and receptive to my well-practiced opening line, and soon he was telling me what he enjoyed about getting high. I listened, asked open-ended questions, wanting him to know I was listening.
The following is based on an actual conversation about eating babies. Don't act like you haven't had one of those.
We need to remember that while neuroscience is fascinating, it's still a relatively new field, and it doesn't have all the answers. And those who share its research findings with the rest of the world have a responsibility to do so prudently so as not to misinform or incite unnecessary anxiety -- especially in an already anxious population.
I think that most women are often running on empty, at least to some degree. Overwhelmed. Stretched thin. They feel like they're being pulled in a million different directions.
By helping your child stay on task, do regular reading practice, and power through even the roughest evenings of work, you are being his best ally.
There is no malice in \mom.\ I've used the m-word many times. But \Jessica,\ my dime-a-dozen first name, is shorthand for something much more complex.
I often hear my friends describe a child as \a nice kid\ and I know they do not say that about my son. My son is wild and unpredictable, always the first to hatch a plan with friends, sometimes a good plan and sometimes a mischievous one.
You or your doctor believes your teenager may be overweight or obese. I know how concerned you must be. The teenage years are tough enough. I'm happy you reached out to me for help, but I want to make sure you understand how I work with teens.
Nobody wants to watch them. Neither do you, though. So this is an impasse, and you lose because you're legally bound to them.
I'm not ready for Sienna to have her mom's sailor mouth, but eventually, when she's a teen, I don't want her to be afraid of speaking the language of her classmates and once she reaches adulthood, I hope to be ready for her to speak such words in my presence as part of normal conversation because the reality is that cursing is ordinary and sometimes, often even, acts as a release for pent up stress.
The best praise is focused on a child's effort, not the child's traits, as I wrote in \Why Some Kids Try Harder and Some Give Up.\ The same is true of criticism.

The important fact is, this conversation is happening. Breastfeeding is being talked about and the questions are being asked.
let's stop decrying family structure and begin focusing on good parenting. The earlier we begin, even before pregnancy, the better for the child.
Rather than feel a little sad for yourself when the rest of the world is talking about the complicated relationships in This is Where I Leave You or what they think of Angelina's second directorial effort, take comfort in reviewing this handy guide to your must-see fall movies.
I think the lie we are fed is that you have to have it all at the same time. That if you are not in a constant state of happiness and bliss with a clean house, well-behaved children and a fat bank account, something must be wrong.
Conscious parenting may sound like it's all apple cider vinegar and handmade socks, but facing good news and bad news with grace and mindful action doesn't always feel natural. In fact, parenting can get particularly awkward when it comes to addressing children's sexual behavior,


As the school year progresses, many parents want to know how they can help their child learn.  We asked teachers and educators, \What are the two traits parents should focus on to assist children this school year?\
There are several reasons people choose not to vaccinate their children, primarily born from misinformation from anti-vaccine advocates.
Christian's room was dark, except for a small blue glow. At 2:37 a.m., he was texting in his bed; I entered Matthew's room and discovered the same disturbing scenario, only he was playing a video game.
Over the years, I have observed that by expressing gratitude for the things around us, we have taught our children (and others) to appreciate the things we all have in life -- whether it's a meal, a beautiful sunset, a car that works or a spouse who is an excellent Mom.
Top app genres and themes are popular for a reason

No, I haven't had a good night's sleep in more than three months because of discomfort, pain and constant kicking inside of me, but I'm grateful that I have a healthy baby who is showing his strength and personality already.
No mom should be made to feel guilty for trying to sleep train her child, even if you disagree with the philosophy. Motherhood is an evolving journey and moms should embrace the diversity, not demean it.
I learned that love -- true, gut-wrenching, walk through fire, lay down everything for someone love -- is simply just holding their hand.
What makes us better is our willingness to be honest about the challenges in front of us, recognize our mistakes and limitations, and still struggle to get it right.

I've always been radically opposed to kids having a sense of entitlement or \status.\ Before I had kids, I always slightly cringed when people would tell their daughters that they were princesses. I felt like it was setting them up for failure somehow.

With over one million apps in the stores, it can be difficult to find just the right app for your kids. And it's even more difficult to find apps you can trust.



I love my daughter. She's beautiful inside and out. Her humor and love of life are infectious. She makes our life as amazing and complete as her two brothers do. Yet she's different -- from her brothers, from other girls her age, and from what I expected.
I'm not going to hover over him all the time and always say \no,\ or act like every object is a hazard. I'm letting him explore the store using his natural curiosity.

The Birthday Cheat Sheet I present here relies heavily on Pinterest (a free and magnificent source of ideas) and your own ingenuity to leverage the small amount of time you do have available to make the most wonderful, special and fun-filled kiddies parties you can imagine!
His diagnosis enabled us to let go of some of the self-blame and shame we were struggling with and reinvest our energy into learning about Aidan's condition and helping him to recover.


I didn't ask for too many details, even when I heard the word \farm\ being thrown about. Because a farm is just a less exotic zoo with no concession stand, right? And maybe I'd get to pet a bunny or a baby pig.
This may come as a surprise to the people who say cruel things like this but women who choose natural birth are humans, too. They actually do have feelings! They think through their choices and decide what is best for them.

Confounded by the conflicting studies and recommendations seemingly at loggerheads? At this point, it is better to tread with caution and limit screen time to the recommended two hours a day, especially in the primary ages, and carefully evaluate the quality of screen time at older ages.
I think we've overlooked the incredible agility, athleticism and dedication that mothers exhibit on a daily basis. That's OK, though, because really, motherhood is much more X-Games than it is the stately and prestigious Olympics, anyway.
After reveling in the glory of solitude and hot water for about 30 seconds, I heard my 2-year-old say, \Poop, floor!\
If you really want to join that golf club, and feel that it's OK because there is one rich black family there, please work harder.\u00a0If you chose to send your children to a school which only has one rich black family, one Hispanic child with a scholarship, and three Asian kids, please work harder.
Hitting a child is never reasonable. It's abuse. And it's time our country stops doing what its parents did, because a country that thinks it's okay to smack, spank, slap, and whoop its kids maybe didn't turn out all that fine after all.
I have a strict policy in my house. No MMO games, or rather -- no MMOs that are actually enabled online. I know, some of you parents and grandparents are saying, \What? What's an MMO?\
It is never acceptable to beat a little kid bloody with a weapon, because that is always child abuse. I can't believe it's 2014 and I have to spell that out for people.
At times, I had relied on their division somewhat to keep from doing things I didn't want to do. Alone they were a single, sometimes whiny voice, but united they were a force, their powers tripled. If they really started working together, they would be unstoppable!
On the brink of turning 40, I fell suddenly pregnant with twins -- where \suddenly\ is redefined as three years of infertility and one round of IVF. My doctor instructed me to eat 100 grams of protein a day, since twins often come early, underweight, and NICU-bound.
When given the opportunity to go somewhere by themselves, they spend half the time missing their child and half the time calling home to check on their child.

With LEGO employing only seven Master Builders in the United States it is unlikely that many of these children will become Master Builders when they grow up. But, any LEGO enthusiast will appreciate learning more about Master Builders do, how to prepare for a life as a Master Builder, and what kids can learn from playing with LEGOs.
Well one child (in private) that he has always been your favorite and you love him more. Warn him if the others EVER found out, they would be devastated. Repeat with however many kids you have. Bonus
Sam, I'm sorry! I just don't know how to help you with math. I've been telling you that ever since Kindergarten when your teacher made fun of me for thinking there was a number called \eleventeen.\
Let's start with what is undeniably the fall's hottest fashion trend
My daughter's view of herself and her place in this world will first be shaped at home. But the world she encounters online, in television, print and music will also have an influence on her perception of self and others.

He asked me recently, \Do you have a husband?\ I said, \No,\ but it bothered me later. I have a life partner whom I've been with for over 20 years, a woman Nicholas calls \Aunt Barbara.\

Forty has answered many -- most? -- of the big questions that haunted my young adulthood. Forty is about embracing the reality that those answers have built.
Well, my 4-year-old daughter has been presented with her very own blonde joke and like many things that happen to my oldest child I find myself wondering if this is a milestone I'm supposed to be celebrating or one I should be shuddering from.
All it takes is a practiced routine, a few (dozen) simple steps, and the patience of a saint to guide your kids to a night of dreamy splendor.

Building the perfect dad brain requires a blend of smarts, morals and karate skills that can't be found in just one movie dad, which is why we used eight, including Clark Griswold, Atticus Finch and, of course, Indiana Jones.
Pink is my boy's favorite color. While I draw the line at hot pink walls in his bedroom, I can identify him on the ice by the pink laces in his hockey skates. Ask Noah, and he'll do his best to convince you that pink is for boys.
As the nation faces a historic moment in the domestic violence prevention movement, let's not forget that children are the often neglected \other victim\ in domestic abuse cases.
I always knew I wanted to breastfeed, I just didn't realize how difficult it would be to wean off.
Work is often a prerequisite for great beauty. Every laugh involves a heave of the chest. Every deep, fulfilling breath moves the diaphragm. Every smile requires the movement of muscles and every glance above requires your neck to fold behind you. Every beautiful thing requires work.
The younger generation has always been a step ahead in adapting to new technologies and platforms. Modern smartphones and tablets have allowed them to evolve into true \digital natives\ as opposed to their parents' generation of \digital immigrants.\
YouTube personalities become popular because they speak directly to their fans, with no network oversight, no whitewashing of their language and no fancy production. They say what they want. They're real. It's important that parents get clued in to who they are.
After a 30-minute-car ride of listening to poop and butt jokes, you arrive at the laser tag arena. Dread begins to fill your heart, as the attendant has just informed you that there is NO ROOM for your party of 13. Your palms begin to sweat.

She is stronger than you. Which makes me stronger than you. Her smile returns my strength and makes me once again renewed and ready to tackle whatever you throw our way.

Managing the emotions that come with this job -- the highs and the lows -- is difficult, and was even before I had a daughter at home. Some nights, I hug my husband and my daughter extra tight.

The same way I didn't want to look back on Katie's last year at home with regret for having spent it stressing out about college, I didn't want to look back and think we spent any spare time boo-hooing that time was winding down.


What if girls were taught to deal appropriately with jealousy long before they ever get to middle school? As a scholar in child development (and thus, a lifelong student of human behavior), I believe they should be. It could have great payoffs later in life for girls and women.
Inclusion is a wonderful idea, and should always be the goal whenever it is reasonable. But inclusion must not be treated as an inflexible ideology.
It was about an hour into our first date when I first learned that my now husband had lost his father in the Twin Towers on 9/11. Now, with a 4-month-old son, my husband and I wonder how we will respond when he someday asks about his grandfather.

Summer ruled when I was a kid because I was a kid. I made it awesome by running and climbing and dancing and playing with friends. She can do that too. And will. Year after year.
I feel like I spent a year at Reproductive Burning Man
While news that your child has a malignant brain tumor remains a life-altering, frightening event, there is renewed reason for hope.
The thing is, I can say with great certainty that if Archie had been a typical child, she would not have even looked twice. In fact, she may have even thought, too bad, punk. But because Archie has Down syndrome, in her mind, he needed to be let off the hook. Um, no.
Schools are embracing digital technologies like never before. However, many parents have a mistaken notion that the tablet or laptop replaces previously-used physical mediums, like the textbook or notebook.
Your morning routine (unlike mine) isn't yet a well-choreographed, finely tuned, precision-drill-team thing of beauty. And that's OK. Perhaps your coffee machine's not brewing at proper jet fuel strength. Or your new meds haven't quite kicked in yet.
Schools and teachers work hard to offer a good education to their students, and a cheerful, willing child who is able to meet them halfway and absorb what they have to offer will do well in their care.
Instead of trotting out the same old stereotypes about what girls and boys are like, we could talk about what our children do; how they move through the world. We could talk about all the ways they are human, and how great it is just to be a part of it.

As a father of four, a long-time soccer fan and a youth soccer coach, here are a few tips that can improve your enjoyment of the so-called beautiful game.
Why do we struggle so to say NO? We don't want our kids to be mad at us. We don't want to disappoint them. We don't want to sit in the blistering storm of their rage.
Until we can look deeply at our consciously and unconsciously held beliefs, until we can accept that racism is an integral part of what it means to be human and that we should acknowledge our own racism in order to evolve and overcome it, things will continue as they are.
I remember when I realized I had a daughter and not just a baby. It was as if the planet shifted, and I felt close to slipping off. All the hard edges revealed themselves, and it occurred to me I would be teaching a girl how to be in a world I had not yet figured out.
Your tummy, the one you told Daddy is \fat,\ is actually perfect. It's the place I lay my head when I want to feel secure, at peace and taken care of. It has the perfect amount of warm padding I need to feel safe when I'm scared, calmed when I'm upset or relaxed when I'm tired.
I wanted him to do it by himself. And I wanted it to be good. I wanted it to be the best damn poster presentation on Spain the kindergarten teacher had ever seen.

The other day I was in the middle of my morning routine of packing snacks, reminding people to wear underwear and ordering them to brush their teeth when I happened to see it, my special needs daughter's red take home folder.
So, what's hot? Apps based on anonymity, where kids and adults can explore questions that can be asked or answered anonymously, are rising in popularity.
We need to teach kids that a little bit of struggle is a normal and expected part of anyone's climb on the learning curve.
We would eat late and long and imagine living in a big building with a big room and a big table -- where we would eat late and long all the days of our lives.

Transitions in life are simply fraught with anxiety and fear of the unknown. None of us, particularly not teenagers are comfortable with ambiguity and the unknown.



There I stood at the foot of the Ferris wheel trying to decide what to do. The idea of leaving Aaron alone, where I could see him but not reach him if he needed me, frightened me more than was probably healthy.
Whether or not your child is feeling anxious about the start of school, you can use this time to talk to principals, guidance counselors and teachers about the importance of creating a classroom and school that feels safe and welcoming.
Great care was taken in choosing these school supplies to further your child's education and put him/her in a \ready to learn\ state of mind, so we ask that you not deviate\u00a0from this list when making your purchases. Some items may only be purchased at village cooperatives in the mountain regions of Asia, so plan accordingly as supplies may be limited.

I cracked an eye, she beamed at me. I tried to keep it open, but the pull of sleep and the resistance to all that the day would hold was too strong. She was still as I drifted off again. Dreams and thoughts chest bumped in my mind, good sleep was over. I opened my eyes.
From the moment that my children had access to things like camera phones or laptops with webcams, I have had numerous conversations about how any photo you take can be shared, and anything that is shared can be seen by the entire world.
So much focus is placed on the well-being of the children as the new school year begins, that parents' well-being, frankly, is kind of forgotten. Of course the kids don't think about it. But what about you?
\Are you excited about the first day of school?\ asked no child ever. This is a question reserved for grownups.






What a wild ride breastfeeding has been. I've never been so determined to do anything, or so ill prepared.
In the beginning, I was their home. I was everything, but now things are a little... different.
I've learned that half the battle in getting kids back to school is the prep you do the week leading up to it. The other half is remaining organized and prepared once the school year starts.
I'm all for introspection and self-analysis and balance and boundaries. I think our kids deserve our time and attention. But I can't help thinking that the idea that children require our 100 percent undivided attention 100 percent of the time has gone a little too far.

\Mommy,\ he piped up from the back seat in his sweet little voice, \I don't like people who have different skin color than mine.\ My brain sort of froze, but I stayed on the road as I gulped in discomfort.

Breastfeeding is our symbol to the world that I will make my best effort to commit to giving my baby the best first food possible, despite my circumstances. And if for some reason if I am unable to, then it was not for lack of trying.
's no secret that girls lag behind boys when it comes to an interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) or that jobs relating to STEM disciplines are the fastest-growing segment of the US economy.
When you are standing in the middle of your bedroom with one sock, two pacifiers, four bedsheets but no idea why you came into the room in the first place, you are not alone.
Hogwarts is run by white people, and let's not touch racism and Tolkien. Where are the South Asian superheroes? The Black people in Dr. Seuss? Make sure your kids know the world they see has missing pieces, missing people and missing stories.
Of course we need to protect our children, but that also means helping them learn how to protect themselves. A generation of kids who has never once felt the autonomy of making their own decisions will potentially grow up to be a generation of very insecure adults.
I often hear this \hit back harder\ advice from adults who are recalling their own playground brawls from 20, 30, or 40 years ago. The simplicity of this advice fails to consider the complexities of the bully-victim dynamics of today's digital world.

Like most parents with juniors and seniors in high school, I've spent some of my summer touring colleges. This was my fifth time around, so I thought it was time to pass on what I've learned.
This year, I've decided I'm not going to stand over her with a timer and a cupcake to coax her to the finish line.


At the core of what I've learnt from Lachlan leaving home is that there are many different ways we are called to be courageous throughout the course of our lives.
There is nothing in your daughter's timeline that you need to fear. Nothing. The only thing worth fearing as the dad of a daughter is not being there to share in her experiences.
I had my first child at the age of 30; maybe that's part of the reason why it seems like my entire life is sectioned into before kids or after kids. There's such a clear difference between life before and life after children, and I have a feeling this is true for each and every mother.



My plan when we picked up the van was to take a picture of me lying dramatically on the hood, giving my saddest \I've been dethroned from coolness\ face. But after driving it for .08 seconds, I realized my shame was vain and THERE ARE TWELVE CUP HOLDERS.
Our college-bound kids know full well that they are leaving their childhood and embarking on the extraordinary journey of crafting their future adult selves.
I'm seeing a lot of \let's stop judging\ pleas lately, but I don't think that's the answer. I judge. Most of us do. Just keep that nonsense to yourself.
I can't accept any longer that crude sexual language, gestures and jokes are merely a harmless manifestation of pubescent development. We can and must educate and empower girls -- and boys -- to stand up to the language and behavior they will inevitably encounter.
Deep down in the depths of my soul, I knew that his purpose in life is being fulfilled. This isn't a fact that is easily accepted. My soul knows something that my earthly body continually fights.
We talked about different truck models, colors and engines. You name it; we chatted about it. But since I personally love cars, I put myself in his shoes and totally got it.
What is the difference between normal adolescent behavior and symptoms of greater issues such as depression? When do you seek help?
Parents are left trying to decide how much to help.  Whether or not to back away.  They often blame themselves.  Or go through a period of time where they deeply question what they could have done.
I'm not sure why I walked into Barnes and Noble that afternoon, except that the \self-help\ aisle seemed like a logical place to be as I pushed the wheelchair of my four-year-old son who had just been diagnosed with a rare, degenerative brain disorder.
I ate my meal in a state of heightened alertness, whispering quick reminders to my kids not to use the butter knife as a drum stick, and to \please use your napkin to wipe off that glob of fruit on your chin instead of your forearm.\
Does all this time staring at screens, which may take time away from looking at faces, change the nature of what we learn about the social world?



Grandparents are often ready, willing and happy to attend school activities, but may fear overstepping their boundaries when it comes to helping out with educational matters.



It is no secret that our childhood has a huge impact on how we feel about ourselves as adults. And so, what better time to lay the groundwork for healthy self-esteem, self-talk and self-belief than during childhood?
When you meet a kid with disabilities, talk to him, not just his parent. If he doesn't seem up for interacting, back off.

I'm dreading The Volunteer Season because of the parents who make volunteering hard. The parents who judge, eye roll, and hrmmph their way through school activities because they are fairly certain they are God's gift to the Land of Volunteer.
Let's visit some of the most frequent comments made to parents of \only children\ and then we will have some fun with some responses that are intended to leave everyone feeling intact.
Be kind to yourself. Forgive yourself for mistakes. Give yourself time to rest and relax and rejuvenate. Figure out what you love and do it. Often. Say nice words in your mind and your heart because you are golden.
One minute I am stressed and miserable. The next, I sigh, my body softens, and I could not be happier. Literally. The highs are so high, they completely dissolve the lows.
Online gift registries are making it easy and convenient for expectant parents to get everything on their wish lists.


People can't be truly happy if cruelty and insensitivity are part of their make-up. To raise successful children, we must cultivate kindness.

Grief is not broken, and it doesn't need fixing. Maybe that's why people are so scared of grief, because the word \broken\ is used so often. Broken is a horrible thing. Broken is something that may mend, but will never heal. Broken will always leave scars to remind us of the pain.
An era ends, and I'm sad, terribly sad. But also so very grateful for the incredible community and the wonderful experiences we have shared as a family.
You may pretend you are fine, functioning, because you are still able to saut\u00e9 the garlic a perfect golden brown and vacuum the dog hair off of the Chinese rug and put on mascara and cut the baby's tiny fingernails without drawing blood. And yet, you are totally detached.
It should be you, as a parent, who talks to them -- especially if your own child has struggled with depression, or other mental health issues.
It was time to get Kate's haircut and we decided to get that old hair out of her way and give her the punk rock, gender-bending haircut our little rock star deserves.
After zipping by that line and getting inside, I made my way up to the bar. What?! $15 for a watered-down Jack and Coke? Good thing my wife's feet were killing her in those five-inch heels because she was ready to go. Yep, we were in there for a whole 15 minutes. Good times.
I won't be there on the beach waiting, worrying about his safety, asking myself whether he put on enough sunscreen. Nor will my husband, or any other adult. My son will be an adult looking out for himself.
While I never spoke to you or even met your eyes, I think of you often.  Your presence is now a concrete part of a significant and sacred memory.

There is still one realm where we are ahead of our kids, and that's in \life skills,\ which are sorely needed--believe it or not--in digital spaces. These life skills include things like kindness, respect, and thoughtfulness, and they're considered skills because in the old days, we actually learned them by observing the behavior of the adults around us.
Next time you see a kid running wild, trailed by a haggard-looking mom with a frizzy ponytail and puffy eyes, just remember
I wish those who pass judgement today could be a fly on the wall of my office and hear the shame, discomfort, and lack of confidence unkind, thoughtless judgements and comments bring to women who bottle feed. Following are some examples that I hope will make people think before they open their mouths in cruel judgement or give disdainful looks:
Too often, these discussions are one-sided. Maybe women are more comfortable talking about such personal challenges, but it seems that many of these conversations leave out that men face challenges in this regard as well.
I asked a group of fathers to share the stories of their paternity leaves (or lack thereof). A few had very supportive employers with generous policies, some had nightmare situations that led to them find employment elsewhere, and most were unsupported and left to rely on their accumulated time off.
I didn't have to think twice about whether I should reply back to the blog site and offer up my 10 Reasons article, or even offer to create another one. I knew after writing one of these lists, and being exposed to hundreds of them daily, I was done.
My younger son came into this world two weeks ahead of time marking his path in life
So we all dream about it -- ahhh, all the great things we'll get to do the minute those darlings go back to school. After a busy summer of trying to keep them busy, it's now OUR time, right moms? So, what first -- nails, lunch with girlfriends, a little rest or shopping?
Whether a child is beginning preschool, third grade, middle or high school, after a long summer or just an extended period at home, starting a school or going back to school is a big change and a big deal. It reverberates the most when the child is not actually at school.
It wasn't a discussion I expected to have with a kid young enough to require interrupting a Disney channel show to do it. But as parents we aren't always afforded the luxury of shining a light on what a bitch the world can be when it's convenient for us.


Youth sports are, and should always be, a valuable experience, filled with challenges, competition and fun. But too many kids are stuck on the sidelines because of an injury that is preventable. In 2013, 1.24 million kids sustained a sports injury severe enough to go to the
My son is leaving for his freshman year of college in four days (but who's counting?). I may have blogged about it a few times here and there (OK, maybe more than that).
The first day of school is also a milestone and a great opportunity to document your child's personality he prepares to start a new grade and track changes in personality as well as growth from year to year.
Friends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood. Somehow, the same people don't ask me.
Walking through the yard, I came across some irises I had purchased 4 years ago. They were thriving, right along with the weeds, even though they were still in the pot they came in when I purchased them. I really need to plant those, I thought. I thought that every time I walked by these irises, but this time, I was going to do it.
Yes, I am proud of my wife's decision to breastfeed. But, if I am being honest, I am more proud of what we learned before her milk ever came in.
It's a scenario parents across the world have faced
I tried to shake off the formula-shaming, even as it added layers of worry to my already tired parent-of-newborn mind. It's not like there was anything else I could do about it
In the past four years, I've watched these girls go from two girls who were basically indifferent to each other to sisters who run around the house screaming and laughing hysterically over the silly games they've made up together.


Depression can lurk just beneath the surface of a seemingly \all together\ or funny or successful person. I think that's why so many were shocked about the news of Williams death being linked to a suicide.
General Mills Canada recognizes that the company doesn't have to denigrate dads to sell a product. This campaign reflects the growing influence of dads as moms' partners in raising children in all aspects of domestic life.
When they were born, they were all potential. We couldn't do anything but start screwing them up from day one.  So, when we see characteristics in our kids that are reflections of our best selves, it's a big check in the win column.
Depression isn't something to be taken lightly or that can be \willed away\ by people who love you. Sometimes all the good, wonderful things in the world aren't enough.
Sleep
When Little Bean asked me, \Mama, what are all those lines across your face?\ I didn't have to think of an answer. My response came easily, a tale simply waiting to be told. \These lines?  These are my storylines...\
I was not this cool about puberty when I was its target. Maybe it was Catholicism, maybe it was the '80s, but I did not look that business of growing up straight in the eyes.

Being a teenager today is not easy. As schools open throughout the country during August and September, teens are dealing with more than the normal stress that we dealt with before technology.
During the four months before my son turned 18, I think I saw him maybe 12 times.  He would leave early in the morning and return late in the evening. When our paths did cross, his eyes were glazed over.
Truth


Regardless of all the responsibilities you have, with children, spouses and partners, jobs and general life chores, you can make time for friends -- as long as you are a bit creative.
May you continue to experience joy through creativity and learning all the days of your life.
Don't those pictures drive you nuts? You know the ones. You see them in the movies, on social media, in advertisements
I stopped breastfeeding my son when he was 2 years, 7 months and 12 days old.  It wasn't easy.
When some doctors told me I would have to stop breastfeeding so I could take medication to get better, I became even more depressed and hopeless. How could I give up the one the one thing I felt I was good at?

When friends ask how it's going with the breastfeeding -- champing at the bit to recount their own milk-making adventures -- it helps me to keep in mind my hospital nurse's wisdom
If kindness is a trait we want our children to embrace, we have to model it. We have to be conscious of how we treat others, what we say about them and how we respond when we're hurt.
Mommy wants to leave the house, but no longer has any matching shoes. This is because my toddler has dragged each pair out of the closet and, after taste-testing them, has banished one shoe from each pair. All Mommy is left with are leather boots from my club-hopping days.
We're not superhuman or infallible. And our kids will wear us down and find this out. When we've got nothing left, they will ask for one more story. While we're having sex for the first time in seven weeks, they will wake up and call for a glass of water. And they will call us on our hypocrisies.


As parents, we play a vital role in keeping our children safe from harm and it is our duty to take whatever steps are necessary to do so.
I am the mother of one high-energy, animated, car-obsessed 5-year-old boy. While he is the center of my universe, he has, at times, left me wanting to pull my hair out.
I have had a child in elementary, middle, or high school for 12 straight years now. I am no longer the new, eager kindergarten mom ready and willing to throw my hand in the air to volunteer and be the homeroom parent contact, fundraising chairwoman or PTA president.
Our parents saw us off from Angie's driveway, and we waved until we couldn't see their faces anymore. Armed with travelers' checks, cash, maps, snacks and the best mix tapes we could create, we headed east.
Change is hard for everyone and we have to help our children through this change with positive self-talk and reminding them of all their positive virtues.
They know when you are faking it. Not that adults can't figure out when you're faking it. But since adults do a fair amount of faking it themselves, they let it pass. Kids don't.
Dr. Allen suggested that while they chase popularity, young teens miss a critical developmental period.
Going back to school is a huge transition for kids, mentally and emotionally. If they are entering a new school, whether that's middle school, high school, or college, it is an even bigger transition.
As an autism parent, it offends me that my children's condition is being used to scare people away from life-saving medical treatments.
The college years can be one of the most memorable periods in your teen's life, a time when your child will discover his/her own identity and forge lifelong friendships. It can be fun, yet there will be challenges; preparing him/her ahead of time can help ease this critical transition.
Let's not forget as parents to teach our kids, boys and girls, the devastating and enduring impact of their \joking\ comments they tweet and post in comment sections on the Internet. It is so easy to lose sight of the fact that there is a real human with real feelings on the other end of anonymous comments made without thinking twice.



Here are five apps and websites to help parents get their elementary schoolers up to speed on a variety of subjects -- including Math, Science, Reading and Geography -- by the time school starts.
Being a parent forces you to constantly be aware of the passage of time. Your life runs to the rhythm of school years and holidays and sports seasons and annual checkups. Parents feel it, and kids feel it too.





Although appellate courts have upheld the right of pregnant women to refuse medical treatments, including c-sections, other actions continue to violate the decision-making autonomy of pregnant women.
My experience nursing my four children was like night and day. I went into it with my first daughter, naive. Before I even had her, I assumed I would breastfeed and it would be easy. Little did I know there were days I would end up in tears, both of us crying in frustration from my lack of milk.
Over the July weeks, blueberries ripen, dark purple-blue, gaining volume and sweetness. If you sneak one early, it is too tart; if you wait until the right afternoon, warm sweetness explodes, the taste of summer.  What else happens in those days it takes for blueberries to ripen?
Now that my daughter is 4, I worry about how to raise an exuberant girl to be true to herself and resilient as she confronts the harried perfectionism and success-driven ethos of our culture. Sound familiar? Here are a few things I try to keep in mind on my own parenting journey.
There may come a time in your life when you feel weak or inadequate. Please remember what you were able to accomplish entirely of your own will and your own fortitude. You are strong.
\Mommy! Get that ball!\ My 5-year old calls out as I'm walking out the door holding a coffee in one hand, a water bottle under my arm, my 40-pound pocketbook over my shoulder, two camp knapsacks over the other arm and a bag of dirty clothes for the dry cleaner.



for those who believe that parental leave, for every sex, is good for everyone, it's not yet time to break out the champagne.
5.  You start talking in the third person with no pronouns ever. \Sally wants a snack? Mommy will get Sally a snack. Sally, sit right there while Mommy gets Sally a snack.\
A caffeinated latte or diet soda may seem like just the quick fix for an afternoon energy slump, but it can lead to a crash.
While being an older parent has it perks -- like being more settled in your career and life, in general -- it also poses unique challenges, especially when it comes to money.
Although I do feel strongly about my personal position on most parenting topics, I've come to realize that my allegiances to them don't have to dictate who I'm friends with as a mom.
Our country has, at long last, matured into the ability to face, and even accept, today's changed social realities. But changed attitudes have not translated into changed policies. And families are paying the price.
Last night I lost it. It's been a long time since I felt helpless, panicked, visceral fear. The war, in an instant of a second, became personal and tangible and even more horrifying and terrifying.


The world can be a vulnerable place when you're 2, when there are so many questions, so many puzzle pieces to adjoin. When Mommy laughs at you for trying to make sense of your world. I see the hurt spread, seep into her posture. She grows quiet, looks at me like I've made her feel foolish. Because I have.

My default mode is to see and focus on my flaws and imperfections. I'm starting to see a bit more.
We made a decision as a couple that for us to thrive as a family we had to learn how to embrace change. We never complained to our children about daddy's dialysis treatments and schedule because we chose to embrace it.
Getting enough sleep and eating well are critical for your child's growth and development. However, a few sugary treats and the occasional late night won't compromise his health in the long run.
I know you think that all of your actions are in the best interest of your child, but I want to share some lessons learned in the hope that you stop doing some of those seemingly well-intentioned things. I was forced to stop. I hope you choose to.
I have 22 years of parenting experience. I've read hundreds of articles on how to parent. Often, I do find suggestions and insights that help, but parenting has a way of leaving me feeling humble, human and in need of more -- and so my quest for tools and tricks continues.
Last night, I did something many of us parents don't do often enough... I remembered what it's truly like to be a kid. I got to turn off my parent radar for just a few awesome hours.
20. Somehow they acquired their own sourdough starter and plan to open their own pop-up bread stand in their friend's garage.

Looking at photoshopped images of models is bad enough for our collective self-esteem. What will photoshopping our kids to look like they stepped out of a J. Crew kids catalogue lead to?
My daughter was now an adult. I happily assumed the role of valet, returning her rejected items to plastic hangers. She had found a comfortable role for me; and I realized my influence and duties had changed forever.
Lately, I've been seeing more teens texting while driving in my town, and many of these young people are not that much older than my son.

No one thinks that this is something that could happen to them. No nurse thinks this is going to be her patient. But it can happen, it does happen, and it is happening every day in the United States.
Parenting kids... man, it rocks you to the core. You think pushing them out is gonna be the hard part -- they call it labor for a reason. But that is a Disney cruise compared to the years that follow.
Artwork that you are dying to recycle but are not allowed to recycle and that you will recycle in seven months when your kid forgets about it... 20 points
I did not name 'apples' and 'bananas' and 'carrots' as I wound through the produce department. I did not stop at the lobster tank to point and ogle those creepy creatures trying to claw their way to the water's edge.
Please explain to me why I would pay someone to tell me that I cannot call or speak to my daughter for two weeks?
I'm the mom who's just a little bit scandalous. A marriage between Auntie Mame and Mae West. And, coming from my kids, that's not a compliment.
I have two sons, but because of circumstances surrounding their births, the bonding process felt instant and natural with my first child, but came much later with the second.

It doesn't take long for kids, especially those with chronic issues, to develop phobias to doctors, specific offices and treatments. From my years as a waiting-room hopper, I've learned how to make the best of doctor's visits for me and for the kids.

This is not the way the story in my head went for the past 18 years. The story in my head was always that we would pack up his belongings together, laugh out loud at the tiny discoveries we would uncover as we found childhood treasures long forgotten. That was not HIS story.
People have had children to secure marriages and to save them, to bolster an identity and belong, to vouchsafe their virility, out of blind Darwinian compulsion and entirely by accident
Taking a babysitter along on the family vacation provides you with the freedom and support necessary to truly feel like you're on vacation. It gives you the flexibility to see sights that aren't kid friendly, enjoy nightlife, and participate in activities that are not possible when you're caring for young children.
As your typical flawed mother, I've been apologizing to my children pretty much since the day they were born. Now I have the chance to use my apologizing skills for a whole new set of screw ups.

No matter what your husband, boyfriend or fianc\u00e9 has said to you, the truth is, he has peed (or if he's lucky, is still is peeing) in your shower.



I am not suggesting that you make a u-turn and start being your teen's friend. I'm suggesting instead that you remember to teach your child about the importance of work, the importance of love and the importance of play.
Avery ate a Freeze Pop and watched a crew of teenage girls of all sizes race around a pool. I wish that I didn't, but I found myself thinking, I'm so glad that she's just eating a popsicle. I don't want the day to come when it becomes about calories and whether or not she deserves it.


It was a usual evening. After finishing with the homework, I was ushering the kids out the door for their playtime when I suddenly felt a sharp, debilitating pain in my abdomen.   I staggered to the couch and slumped into it.

With kids around, my husband and I have to get creative with how we flirt, communicate desire and find privacy. And it's amazing the things we now find to be quite flirtatious and sexy.

Before the outburst, I'd told myself I'd stay cool. We were doing what was best for C and that is what mattered. This whole thing was not a value judgment on him or on our parenting. And yet, suddenly, I was the parent who did not want to hear it.

A noodle twirler, bug collector, Frisbee hurler, toy inspector, finger snapper, maze constructor, gift unwrapper, train conductor, hula hooper, snowball thrower...

My heart soared with joy. She fit in! Then I immediately felt guilty. I shouldn't be glad that my daughter looks like the masses.


You want what's best for your children, you want them to be happy, but you want to be happy too. Parenting strategically can help.
It takes a lot for moms to take a little time off. I mean, motherhood is a 24/7 job, right? And we love it. Well, most of the time. But even moms need a day or two to unwind.

Before my son's birth, I envisioned long afternoons of cuddling and bonding, making gourmet meals for my husband and catching up on the books on my nightstand that had gone ignored while I worked full-time. It was going to be fabulous... and then our son got here.
My maternity leave was coming to an end and I was feeling the fear of going back to work increase daily. On one hand, I was excited to return and put that hard-earned master's degree to good use. On the other hand, I was devastated.

Ah, summer. Endless days and even longer nights. It's the perfect time to focus on capturing what makes the days special for your family.
It took a long time, therapy and experimenting with different anti-depressants, but I finally, finally emerged from the abyss of depression and anxiety, and began to enjoy my son and my life again.
Last week would have marked my twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. Although my former husband and I have been parted now for many years, when the date rolled around and I did the math, I felt it as a momentous occasion.

here is a place for moderation in all things, including extra-curricular activities. Balance is the key to benefit. During the summer, children should have a chance for a time out, so they can take time in.

ALL bodies -- yes, ALL bodies -- are gorgeous and worthy of being photographed and loved, whether they be covered or nude.
I am definitely not a perfect parent. Sometimes things slip my mind, but I can assure you I never forget my kids in the car. So, my solution and challenge for all parents
Sometimes it's tentative and other times it's brazen, but at some point people almost always ask if my husband and I got pregnant on purpose.
Happy 4th of July to all who celebrate, both home and overseas. Those with their loved ones and those without. Those dreaming about a better tomorrow and those fighting for it.

There has been much debate about the usage of handicapped bathrooms. Some people feel like they should be used exclusively by handicapped individuals, and others say they are built for handicapped individuals, not reserved for them. I would like to offer my opinion and experience as a mother of a child with special needs.
Gwen and I have decided to cosleep. That means that little baby Noah sleeps in bed with us. Cosleeping brings up a few questions and concerns and sometimes even an angry mob with pitchforks and torches.

My brows furrowed, my mind raced. Are you kidding me? I thought. Are you really setting the bar that low?
When we tell them they're the best at everything or the smartest of all, it creates a problem when they figure out they aren't. Let's not raise a bunch of ego maniacs who don't have the skills to live healthy rounded lives.

My husband sent me this email...\The maintenance light in the minivan has been on for weeks. Do you think you can take the car in soon?\


Don't re-enact the alien-through-the-stomach scene from Alien with your kids using a real alien in their stomach.
Breastfeeding is one of the most wonderful, heart-wrenching, soul-healing, self-doubting, self-confidence crushing and self-confidence boosting experiences I've ever had.

Nutrition is such a great area for children to practice planning. It not only helps children become healthy eaters beyond the childhood years, but it strengthens these high-level cognitive skills as they are developing.
Our bodies don't stay the same; of course they don't. They evolve, they show signs of a life lived, a life loved. As they should. They bear witness to where we've been, that we've been. They are like maps that tell the tale of our time, our travels.
I brought them to the hospital and hung onto them the whole time; through the squeeze of the contractions and the sting of the needles and the pushing and the sweating and the crying and the expansion of pride at the amazing creature that was all of a sudden... there.


Few people would disagree that we've become a divided society with our own thoughts and beliefs taking precedence over tolerance and understanding. But what is it doing to our children?
1. Super-luxe, pearly-iridescent, pressed face powder. Oh no, wait. On second glance, I believe that's roughly, and I'm just spitballing here, about one third of a cup of ground up Cheerio dust.
Happiness isn't something students achieve through test scores, winning season and college acceptance letters. If we redefine happiness for our children and teach them that positive actions increase positive emotions, we send a message that prosocial behavior is important.

There is a sort of unwritten code when raising children; a list of gender rules which we are all aware of that make us wonder (and sometimes worry) if they will be true for our kids.

I choose to put my faith in the things I can see or that can be proven
It's easy for work-at-home moms to feel frustrated when our children are sick or home for a holiday or a vacation because we're so focused on how the schedule changes affects us negatively. And yet the real motivation to be a mom who works from home is to be with our children, to be able to be here for them.


Between the fundraisers, the soccer and T-ball games, the family celebrations and topping it off with Girl's Night Out, when do these people have time to sleep? And it's not just weekends. The madness happens on weeknights too.

Sure, they seem like clean beings at home. They shower daily, wash their faces and brush their teeth... but until their camp counselors actually physically force them into the shower, they will not shower. Just assume a few good swims in the lake will suffice.
What makes a great man? Eeek, that's a tough one! Or, more importantly, what kind of men do we want our little boys to become? And, how can we better support them as they develop?
Going from two to three naturally added to the circus. However, in some respects, we had become experts at managing madness.
We're teaching them to be human, after all -- flawed and still fabulous. Messy and still magnificent. Weird and still wonderful, and always deeply, deeply worthy of love.

Sometimes words just aren't enough. As much as I am in love with words, as much as they tirelessly enrapture my mind each day, sometimes they just can't encompass the depths of what I feel.
While it's easy to gripe about the annoyances, I think it's also important to embrace the sweetness of this stage.
Time outs are a proven parenting tool when implemented correctly. They are one of the few disciplinary strategies recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics to reduce problem behaviors including non-compliance, oppositional actions and verbal and physical aggression.
It is easy for little ones to love the idea of a little brother or sister, and an entirely different matter when that real baby is co-opting mommy's affection and attention.
I have one non-nursing bra that I wear when I go out (rarely). I usually take it off in the car on the way home because I simply cannot stand it a moment longer. Thankfully, my husband doesn't ask too many questions when I come home from ladies' night with my bra off.
At \press time,\ Gemma is almost 5 years old. I'm writing you this letter because, while I love my daughter with all my heart, and I'm trying really hard to be a great mom, I'm pretty sure I'm doing most things wrong.


It took me 10 times as long to think of the questions as it did for my daughter to answer them. In the end, she gave me some very 9-year-old answers. But they still show some areas where I can grow and work to become a better dad and parent.
Whenever we're strolling in the neighborhood, someone always comments on my daughter's hair. I've considered that maybe people are complimenting her and that I shouldn't take it too seriously. But then I realize their comments are always directed at her hair.
Boredom is not a problem to be solved. It is an itch to scratch.
The moment they walked out the door for nursery school, middle school, college or their \real life,\ I will know them a little less.
You will learn to be a fighter.  You will find strength you never realized you had and overcome your fear of confrontation.  You do this because not doing this is not an option.  That baby girl needs you to be this way. And you're not about to let that girl down.
The Internet offers an unprecedented treasure trove of information and resources for all of us, and for our kids. But the recent \Slenderman\ incident, for lack of a more family-friendly phrase, has thrown a spotlight on the uneasy relationship that parents have with the online world.

He was wearing a perfectly fitted suit, and a tightly knotted tie. In the photo, I see my dad as confident, assertive, and filled with an optimism that defied the poverty and political unrest of 1960s Korea.

The experience was, not surprisingly, as much -- or more -- about my older kids as it was about the baby.

With Father's Day upon us, it is time to speak to the unacknowledged grief of men who suffer baby loss.
As a mother, I often wonder how much of what I'm teaching my boys really sinks in. This week, I've realized that the lessons our parents teach us do matter.


It's simple, really. There's one thing that would help new dads become better fathers
When our babies are little, there are so many lasts that people warn us about. We're on alert for the last time they pronounce that one word in that sweet, incorrect way. The last time they toddle. But as my girls get older, I realize that I'm entering a whole new round of lasts.
Congrats! You just found out your pregnant... now what?! The feelings of anxiety and angst will likely overcome your mind in matters of minutes. Why? Because you start thinking about your current situation, your job, your lifestyle, your apartment, the social world with which you associate, finances, and the list continues.

Bringing a baby into this world is truly a miracle and I can confidently say that the past 12 months have been the best 12 months of my entire life. This post is my take on being a father, and the top 10 lessons I learned.
Even though we no longer live in a Leave It To Beaver society where gender roles are unwavering, they still play a part in modern parenting. Yet striving for equality doesn't mean we have to obliterate masculinity and femininity, or discredit the disparities between our experiences.
Can somebody be a good mother and also have lust? Could somebody behave erotically with their partner knowing a baby in the next room? Honestly, I wasn't sure.
You would never know this kid struggles with heart problems and has been through three eye surgeries. Sitting on our set, clapping her hands and bobbing to Pharrell's \Happy,\ she was the picture of pure glee.
You can't always poop where you want. But if you try sometimes, you just might find you poop where you need.
Talking about alcohol with your children is never easy, but educating teens and then trusting them to make informed decisions is critical.
The Hindus say that \the mother's lap is the child's first classroom.\ Neuroscience helps us to understand just what is being taught and learned on this lap of love and it's importance not only to the child, but to society and mankind.
Spending the weekend at an organic farmer's market, buying a variety of exotic foods to encourage a sophisticated palate in your child, shelling out a lot of dough for environmentally-responsible means of travel... for a certain set of parents, these are activities to be proud of.
This Father's Day weekend, I encourage you to let go and let dad be who he is. Whether that dad is your own, your husband, your brother or your friend, just let him be Dad.
Most births don't have complications but some do, and it is unfortunate when women feel they or their births are failures for failing to meet their preconceived notions of success. Women should strive for a birth that is manageable and meaningful, but without a sense of entitlement that it must be fast, painless, and stoic.
For the younger kids (pre-school through second grade), the school plays by the \everyone's a winner\ rule. Each class is called up as a large group and the awards are passed out one by one. While I prefer a little competitive action when it comes to awards, I try to contain myself. \Try\ being the operative word.

New studies show that yoga can benefit pregnant women's emotional health, reduce labor pain and delivery time, and prevent pregnancy complications.
He taught me to work and love hard, and feel grateful for the hardness because it makes all the sweeter parts of life that much more so. In other words, he taught me how to parent.
I think it is important for us as parents of special needs children to realize that the world is catching on -- that others are opening their hearts to these amazing children and their families.
If we judge parents for putting their kids at very low risk, we could jail them for serving solid food (the child could choke!) letting them walk down stairs (the child could fall!) or permitting them to join a sport (concussions!).
What she was actually doing was attempting to assert her dominance over me via a gradual wearing-down process, one vegetable at a time. It's possible that she was winning.
When you have five young kids, your life is an endurance test. Each day you feed, clean and care for your offspring so that you can be awarded the grand prize at nightfall of no longer having to answer any kid questions like, \If an ant dies, do his ant friends have a funeral?\

On some level, I believed atheism was hereditary. That the composition of my DNA couldn't produce anything other than me. And so, when my first daughter was born, I made a conscious effort to introduce her to religion. I wanted to make sure that whatever beliefs she formed, they were of her own making, not mine.
Angel Belle was alive during the entire delivery process. My wife felt her kicking throughout. Her heartbeat was strong. And then it was not. After being delivered, Angel Belle took a single breath while her heartbeat slowly faded.
The greatest outcome of this entire ordeal is that I will send a powerful message to my children
Women deserve to know the full range of medically viable options for feeding their children, in an unbiased, accurate, and judgment-free manner, and a consumer protection organization should be at the forefront of that fight.


I stood off to the side, my heart beaming with pride, my eyes filling with tears, and wished that I could have known last year, as I lost sleep and grew more grey hairs, that kindergarten isn't about the end of childhood at all. It is so much more about beginnings.
I'm not hard-pressed to find positives in my daughter's autism diagnosis, and I'm guessing Woody and Jessie might feel the same.
Fatherhood is full of unscripted moments like these. To excel at it, or at least to keep our heads above water, we dads must be nimble enough every single day.
I feel guilty when I am tired after work and my son is not. I feel guilty when I hear a teacher colleague of mine saying to another colleague, \Oh, she can't be a helpful volunteer, she works.\
\You could probably handle this better if you were younger.\
These are the kinds of words I want to excise from my kids' vocabularies, or at least severely limit, whether or not anyone else hears them.
I used to watch my dad garden. Watch metal strike soil, submerge and uncover, lift earth still dark under graying mulch. Watch him edge the flower beds, prune the pear trees. Study his hands as he'd loosen marigolds from plastic, plant and cover their roots with a swift hand.
Success to us meant that he would be a good person living a meaningful life, earning a living following his passion.
In a home where the \Good Cop, Bad Cop\ parenting philosophy reigned, us kids knew exactly which parent would oblige to our irrational requests.
You never know how much a compliment might help another person get through a tough moment, a tough day or a really tough patch of parenting.

Family man. The lovely old-fashioned phrase evoked visions of my own father, long gone and sorely missed. Love, comfort, protectiveness, understanding... all tendered in two simple words from a simpler time

When faced with first-time fatherhood at the age of 49, I didn't know whether to celebrate with champagne or hemlock... whether to jump for joy or jump off a cliff. But it's turned out to be the most interesting and rewarding thing I've ever done.
While there's nothing definitive you can do to prevent an eating disorder in your child, there are steps you can take to reduce the risk, and increase the chance of her (or him) having a positive body image.
I see it all the time
She's dying. My 9-year-old daughter is dying. Today I can say it without crying, but not necessarily tomorrow.




If all parents sit down with their children and tell them that identifying boys or girls by colors is wrong, the kids will have no choice but to understand that.
I'm worried that there are just too many Internet destinations selling an idealized version of motherhood that no one can live up to. Because motherhood is beautiful, but it's also messy. In fact, I would even argue that happy family life SHOULD be messy. A lifestyle blog of only perfect moments is not a lifestyle I'm familiar with.
The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NYSPCC), the first child protection agency in the world, wants all children to have a safe and happy summer. Here are our tips for keeping children safe.
It's a sad fact that I now consider a trip to the dentist as \me\ time. I pray I don't get the chatty hygienist and that I can just close my eyes and have 30 minutes of quiet.
If you had asked me what Kate's greatest sensory discomfort was, I would have said it was related to her hair. Until today, she did not let us brush her hair and a proper haircut was out of the question. Then something changed.
I worry I could end up 80 years old, Rubbermaid bins full of my children's clothes stacked to the ceiling.

I gave birth to a healthy, incredible baby girl two weeks after we discovered I was pregnant. It was lucky, and a blessing, to have everything turn out so well. But as many mothers know, the journey did not end there.
I am the guardian of my children's souls, and I have been fighting against the system for years to no avail. The only way I can effectively fight is by opting out. No afterschool activities. No SAT testing. No sad Kumon. No tutoring. No \checking\ their homework.
Out of all the changes that a new baby brings, the most drastic change, in my experience, is what you and your partner talk about.

We know how challenging it can be for parents of children of color to find books in which characters of their ethnicity are represented -- and not limited to tired stereotypes or only relegated to minor characters.
You were by my side as I fell madly, deeply, head over heels in love with the beautiful little boy who completed our family.  You supported me as my first sweet son curled up behind me in the rocking chair.  You told me that we would all start healing together.
If you haven't been inside your child's classroom lately, find some time to go look around. Take note of what's lacking. And if you can afford to in even the smallest way, improve it.
It has been 27 hours since I've pumped. I'm uncomfortable and my breasts are engorged, but they've felt worse. The pain, itself, is not so bad. I just wasn't expecting the emotional part to hurt so much.
The two women in front of me spent the entire flight speculating as to why that \sweet man\ was traveling alone with that baby. \Should we offer to help him get his stuff off the plane?\ they asked. As the plane went up, my jaw continued to drop.
Strength comes in showing kids that there's never a need to repress feelings and there are always people there to help if you're brave enough to ask. The best example I can set for my kids is to ask for the help, and more importantly, to accept it willingly. The tears don't matter.
I wish I had savored my son's preschool years the same way I am enjoying his current tween phase. Ten is great, but he'll never be 3 again, and that makes me feel a little... not sad, quite, but wistful, perhaps. Because 3-year-olds have a lot to offer, too.
We are not perfect and we make mistakes all the time. It's ok. Just commit yourself to being on this side of the fence, where gossip is minimal, women are non-threatening, and kindness rules... the grass is definitely greener.
It was always amazing to me that Theresa was able to write with such clarity so soon after losing her husband. Of course, in many ways, her biggest struggles as a new, widowed mother were yet to come.
I recently stood in the middle of a madhouse. Kids in electric-orange socks, like a too-bright dystopian fantasy, sprinted past me in every direction. Adults in coordinating electric-orange T-shirts stood guard. All that was missing was the heavy arm of an unseen totalitarian regime. Only, it wasn't exactly missing.
I notice the stare-glares every single time, and a mix of emotions runs through me
You hope everyone likes how it turns out but mostly you don't care because you're just happy to have gotten through it.


If you just take a moment, you can put yourself in my shoes. We're all mothers, and we can do that for each other. At least that. We can relate.
Hip Mama's unapologetic cover is too much for some people. Just like breastfeeding still is.
The Internet is just like the world. It can be wonderful and amazing or frightening and terrible. Each person must choose the path to take.

We ask our children to press \play\ when we need to prepare for the pool (e.g.,generously applying sunblock, consistently fastening a lifejacket, patiently walking towards the pool, etc.) and to press \pause\ when they potentially may get too excited.


Jack was fragile. He would require open heart surgery by the time he was 6-months-old. Any of us would have done anything to make him well, but there was nothing we could do. As I recalled our five months together, I realized that there were no regrets. That was the first lesson Jack taught me.
This date, this \July 10th\ is now something that I see printed on food cartons as expiration dates, warning and taunting me that it is not as far away as I believe it to be.
Seriously? That much physical change has occurred in all four of my (not so) little people? Faces went from kid to teen. Bodies stretched out a few inches. Hair grew. Shapes shifted. And that's just their external selves.

Two years ago, I launched MomAlways.org, a website that has no business getting international traffic almost every day. But most mornings when I look at the website's analytics, I see a mix of visitors.

Watching him skip and jump, I promised myself I would continue to be inspired by this family. On those long days when I'm convinced I lost the genetic lottery with autism, I will remind myself that this not a game to win or lose, but a life of love and hope and possibility.
Something must be done, so here is my list. Borrow it, steal it, share it, whatever you do just invent one thing here and you will go down in parenting folklore as a hero.
Beauty abounds in the most unexpected places, making the minor and mundane suddenly magnificent. The trick is to include yourself in this expanded version of beauty.
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend TED2014 and I was very excited about what psychologist Phillip Zimbardo had to say. He spoke about how men are failing socially, academically and with women. His TED talk struck a nerve with me.



These days, it's becoming more and more impossible to define \normal.\ That's a good thing. Most children have friends or neighbors whose families aren't exactly -- or, in some cases, remotely -- like their own.
Back in the 1980s there were only three crafts in existence
We grieving parents already know that we are a\u00a0living, breathing representation\u00a0of your worst nightmare. And as great as it is that you have some perspective, we don't need to be reminded that it's at\u00a0our expense.
The idea that a calorie is a calorie, that everybody should just eat less and exercise more and that if you're overweight it's simply a matter of willpower -- all the stuff we've all come to accept as medial fact over the last few years -- is thrown out by the panel of experts in Fed Up.
Today is Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution Day and the theme this year is \Getting Kids Excited About Food.\ To mark the occasion, here are the top five reasons why you should invite your kids into the kitchen and just embrace the chaos.
Like the mat version that came before, don't forget to give yourself a few minutes of recovery after practice. Feel free to lay down, face up on the floor. But I don't recommend closing your eyes. It helps to be able to see the diapered butt that's guaranteed to plop down squarely onto your face.
I had come this far and felt deep down I could have a natural childbirth. All caveats aside, women have been doing this for thousands of years, right? Well, the problem was now I began to \think\ that I had been given the option to relieve the discomfort because perhaps I wasn't strong enough.
Now, I will nurse anywhere, but I didn't come to realize the power of my mama-stripes overnight. I had to see the gutter to make the choice to leave it. To make a stand; proud and determined that my daughter and I deserved more.
If you accept the position that the only thing corporations should care about are profits, then a trend that decreases profits might be thought of as harmful. But the only perniciousness that I see is the inherent danger of a profit-only mentality that views a thoroughly wholesome, healthy, environmentally beneficial trend like parents making their own baby food as pernicious.
What if we stopped the wars? What if, instead of attacking each other's decisions, we calmly discussed them and shared information, throwing each other a new rope when we see that others are getting to the end of theirs?
I have a confession. I have been up all night feeling sickened. I am sickened with worry about the plight of the hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls who were kidnapped from their school-Chibok Government Girls Secondary School in Nigeria.
She'll tell me that the ladybugs are sleeping on the windowsill (must call the exterminator). That bees are hiding in the flowers, that the man in the truck across the street is sad. That we need to buy bananas and Cheerios at the supermarket (we do).
There is no greater full-circle moment than taking your child to play ball in the same field you played on as a kid. I crouched behind home plate while my dad pitched
There is no one thing that makes someone a girl, and more importantly, you could not think of a less insulting insult than to call someone a girl. Many girls like flowers. Many boys like hockey. I like flowers and I like hockey. Don't define people and their traits by their gender, define them by how helpful or hurtful they are.
Despite what common sense might say, there are not an a variety of ways to raise good children. There is only one. And I know it. And you don't. So I'm going to educate you (you're welcome).


Sitting with my children at a local restaurant for dinner last night, a time I would have been checking my phone, or posting cute pictures to Instagram, I felt the intensity of our family -- the sharing of French fries, the coloring of underwater scenes on the white paper covering the table, the exhaustive giggling over making bubbles in water. That too is life's terms
I am enough when I buy a store-bought potato salad to take to the school party. I am enough when things go wrong. I am enough when things go very, very wrong. I am enough because I am a mother.
Just spending a few minutes on Facebook, Pinterest or Instagram makes me realize I'm surrounded by super moms. I really don't mean to, but I end up comparing myself to these moms. Where did my super cape go?
Some days my brother and I put in a full workday in front of the tube, complete with tray tables so we could watch through breakfast and lunchtime. Based on conversations with friends, their homes were also full of many hours of television as well. And guess what? We're all fine.
Research can be confounding when it comes to understanding what is considered best parenting practices these days. Do you praise a child's behavior or their character? Focus only on rewarding or also include punishment? Praise unconditionally or only in response to good behaviors?
There is a form of preparedness that has nothing to do with money. It has everything to do with the price tag attached to genuinely preparing young adults for the world into which they will soon graduate.
I'm certain the soundtrack to hell is identical to the sound of my screeching alarm\nBuzz buzz buzz at 6:00 a.m., get up -- there are so many things to be done.
When the nurse placed my first swaddled newborn on my chest right after I gave birth, I believe the first words out of my mouth to my husband were, \I am so f#@ked.\ And I still feel that way. Because before kids I was pretty invulnerable.
That's what life is -- messy and filled with highs and lows. And, when it comes to motherhood, we need to normalize the lows.
New parents usually start out not knowing what to do. They find it easier to go back to their old ways of living life before their baby arrived.
Being labeled smart has a lot of drawbacks. It places a person on a pedestal, and if they take risks, they might fail, and lose the their smart status. Plus, when someone is gifted, they shouldn't have to work hard... right? Stupid people have to put effort into something. Or at least that is what's commonly understood.
Leo appreciates your patience, because, like so many autistic people, it sometimes takes him a few beats to process spoken words. So give him a moment, once you've said something to him. You don't need to simplify your language or shout; he can hear you.
My tummy has housed three babies and my boobs have provided over 4,000 meals to my tribe; for that I am proud of my body and no longer ashamed.
To all you new moms out there who don't have hair stylists, live-in nannies, personal trainers, makeup artists or house cleaners... not only are you not alone, but you are doing a great job.
We deride helicopter parenting, but maybe the problem is that we are thinking of the wrong person in the wrong helicopter. It's the children, not the parents, who are meant to fly.

Should we believe that our biological urges are powerful enough to override our well-evolved sense of logic and reason that looks at what is to come (and is inevitable, no matter what the self-help parenting books try to convince us otherwise)? The reason cannot be spoken; only felt.
Several friends asked me if I am worried about getting fat. No, actually, I am more terrified about what will happen to my lady bits during and after birth. Thanks, Grandma.
The cute notes have turned into emails and texts throughout the day about how many diaper changes the baby has had. The long, thoughtful conversations that used to happen over dinner now take place over the shouts of babies and toddlers screaming and throwing their food.
It warms my heart when my children see me come back from a run or a CrossFit workout and ask, \Mama, did you have fun exercising?\
Something incredible happened on my 38th birthday. My heart became unwrapped in a way that released emotions I was not aware were waiting inside of me. I gave birth for the first time, after years of heart break and disappointment, and I finally felt the love of my life
I don't mean to sound like a fangirl but The Fault In Our Stars is every bit as amazing as all the screams and cheers would indicate. (My own teengirl and I read it as part of our own ongoing book chat and we both give it an A+.)
For many mothers, self-care is not an easy task. And when we are unable to meet our basic needs tending to our deeper emotional needs becomes trickier.
Hiring someone whose work history has a five-year or more dark spot may feel like a mighty risky thing for you to do. I'm here, as an undesignated SAHM spokesperson, to tell you that you should take that risk. Your company needs her. You need her savvy and her flair.
Some days, I am astonished that I am the mother to three children. After all that loss, such wonder. And, how grateful I was to have children who love me, who loved me with hugs and understanding when my own mother died.
We are quite consciously taking great steps to make sure that our son knows how to manage his own allergies and doesn't perceive himself as a victim. However, when one of the below questions is asked, it always touches my heart and makes me feel a surge of appreciation and affection for the friend who is asking it.

When I look back on the efficient, well-oiled machine that was my childhood household, I don't remember as much chaos, scrambling and disorder.
In the hours and days after having my baby, I cried. This is a normal part of childbirth as your hormones go crazy. But at some stage during the days after childbirth and before leaving hospital the tears morphed into worried thoughts of death and dying.

Breastfeeding in public has been a hot button global debate over parental rights and public behaviors for decades. New furor ignited recently in England when a mother was ousted from a store for nursing her child.
I knew from the first time you spilled apple juice in your lap at the kitchen table that we were going to be great friends.
Giving birth is scary, but it is only the initiation into multiple stressful experiences awaiting new mothers. Here are the most stressful obstacles to overcome in the 72 hours post-birth.
We don't need to model getting everything right. That would be too neurotic. It's OK to mess up. We just need to model taking responsibility, apologizing for our mistakes and forgiving ourselves.
Before you judge the mother of a little boy with long hair, take a step back and consider the bigger picture. What has this family been through? What has this little boy been through?
I explained the process of meeting agents, taking classes and auditioning in my best age appropriate language. My daughter was over the moon with excitement and couldn't wait to get out there and hit the pavement. Point is, I listened.
I thought of my mother, the young widowed mother, who never complained or sighed or rolled her eyes when the sink was full of dishes or when I slammed my bedroom door because I was a pre-teen and hated all of the world and everyone in it.
Feeling like you never get things right creates dissatisfaction and frustration. Being disappointed is healthy part of life so parents should be honest about what they aren't good at and speak out when they get stuff wrong. \u200eTo err is human.
For many of us, mom was our first teacher. She taught us to recite the alphabet, how to tie our shoes, to swim and not to hit our siblings. This year, we honor moms and their wisdom by sharing the lessons learned from mom by some of our nation's most accomplished people.
Becoming a mom should have cured me of taking my own mom for granted. Only it doesn't seem to work that way. It's a process. With every milestone my kid hits, I make a new discovery about my mom.
Without the confidence she exemplified, I would not have learned the significance of loving myself, and in turn, teaching my daughter to love herself, too. Through my mom, I learned loving yourself is the beginning of all victories.
I recently discovered letters my mother had written (on a typewriter, no less!) to a close friend -- before she became a mother at all. They were from her pregnancy with me, her first, and reflected on how she felt about motherhood as she stood at its threshold.
Although my nest is now empty, I've found I can reminisce about my kids' childhood this Mother's Day by spritzing these scents from Demeter Fragrance Library, which are the next best thing to going back in time. In some ways, they may actually be better.
Mothers, you are all amazing. No matter how you became a mother and regardless of whether you are your child's biological mother of her 20th mother, thank you for being an amazing Mom! Happy All Mothers' Day!

In these more modern times, it's as though we've lost that sense of community where we really allow others to help us with the rearing of our children. We have forgotten or are neglecting to include this as one of our assets as a mother.
My mother has always had a love of music that is infectious, and my memories of the years I spent at home are punctuated with songs from all eras -- Big Band swing to '80s rock.
As children, we often strive for separation and differentiation from our parents, perhaps our mothers in particular. For many of us, our mothers were the mainstay in our childhood lives, the very epitome of regularity and the ordinary. But we don't want ordinary; we want extraordinary.
This Mother's Day, the best way I can honor her and my own children, is to not get through the day, but to get in it. I will take care to move more slowly, live more deliberately and surround myself with the people I love.
If we want them to keep coming back, I think it's important that we dads get our kids to show their appreciation. So I've created a list of 20 things that every mother wants to hear her kids say. I know if my kids repeated even three of these things, my wife would probably have a heart attack.
I was blessed to know from the moment I could understand that one mother gave me life, the other gave me a home. I have also been blessed and fortunate enough to know and love them both, while they have also gotten to know each other.
I'm now a motherless mother to the sweetest boy my mom will never get to meet. But she lives on in me and in him; she has never truly left.
Every year in the beginning of May, I try to allow myself some space to mourn the loss of that pre-cancer life, the time when I could still try to rein in my anxiety and fears with a rational voice, when I could still comfort myself with statistics about the \rarity\ of childhood cancer.
Doing what you love isn't always about a career. It's about making the time in your life for the things that bring you joy.

How many of us celebrate Mother's Day by going to a restaurant with our children? Is it just me, or does that concept seem sort of idiotic?

It's not so much the needing to buy and have nice things that makes me want to get a minivan we can't afford. It's that I want the size and grandeur of my gift to reflect the magnificence of what she has given me.
Not one mom in two years told me she found it hard. That it wasn't easy or natural or normal to suddenly be in charge of another human being.

Yes, my mum taught me how to eat properly and wait my turn in a queue, but really what I grasped is that manners are about respect -- respect for my friends, my family, my environment and especially my elders.
Kids pay close attention to their parents' emotions for information about how safe they are in their family, Cummings says. When parents are destructive, the collateral damage to kids can last a lifetime.
My mother passed away one year ago, right after her 75th birthday. I've spent the past 12 months missing her and wishing she was still here to watch her grandchildren grow up.

Wow, were our games complex. There was I Spy, Make the Trucker Honk His Horn, The License Plate Game, GHOST, Mad Libs, those Yes & Know invisible ink pads, and the saddest game of all
In a sense, for some of us, motherhood is the one thing in life you will do where you will never feel like such a failure, sometimes on a daily basis.
Last year I had the perfect Mother's Day. I went for a run followed by a 90-minute massage and spent an hour on the couch watching an episode of Mad Men. It was everything Mother's Day should be -- but on a Wednesday.

We can't control all of the good and bad things that will happen to our children, but we can give them the tools they need to make their experiences, whether joyous or painful, opportunities for growth.




I am 26. I am in that contradiction of an age where you are young enough to go out, but too exhausted to. Or maybe I'm just too exhausted to. Maybe 30 is the new 20, if you don't have a child.

A lot of it is stressful and loud and crowded and dirty, but the good parts make it all worth it.
The literature demonstrates that the safest, healthiest option for premature and vulnerable infants is an exclusive human-milk diet. Our fragile infants cannot wait around for more evidence, they need human milk now.
If I could travel back in time and tell myself a little something, it would be this
What do writers have to tell us about being dads? Not much, I used to think.
Dear Mr. Grant, I am a new father and am just as hopeful to raise a good and moral child as your readers. I find it hard to swallow J. Phillipe  Rushton as an expert on morality when he is on record saying some pretty nasty things that undermine your essays thesis.
As a nanny and parenting consultant, I have long espoused that we are doing our children a disservice by catering to their every need and catching their every fall. But it's a hard message for parents to internalize, even harder for them to come out and say, and harder still to publish a blog about it!

As you get to know each other, you'll find common ground, and it won't feel like you're on opposite sides. It will never be \perfect\--no relationship is. But if you work at the relationship, you just might learn from each other.
Our children are here to be as human as anyone else and their being human is not a poor reflection of us as parents.
There are ways in which the wisdom of a spiritual tradition can transform the hard, exhausting, crazy work of caring for small children. And if we take the work of parenting seriously, there are a lot of ways in which it might change the way we understand what spirituality is and can be.


How many times have we all asked our children to \smile and say hello politely\ when they seem to feel anything but smiley and polite? That is a lot of pressure. And that pressure had me thinking this week.
You drew the bat to your shoulder again, ready for the real thing. Please just let him get on first, I thought. It will mean the world to him.
We may be able to get our kids fed and dressed on our own, but to raise the kind of people we want to raise? We need a lot of help.
Apparently, it feels \awkward\ and \weird\ and \uncomfortable\ to kiss one's children on the mouth.
Put the book down, Mama. You don't need it. You've got this.
When the doctors said the words \Down syndrome,\ you wondered if she would be beautiful. You wondered if people would pity your family. You wondered if you would be able to sustain your ferocious love for her.
Sometime during that first week of the new year, as I thought very deeply about my grandmother's influence on my life, knowing her light was fading, I began to feel sick and very, very tired.

You might say that motherhood has made me strong. And, I would agree. But it's not my arm muscles that show this strength.
The thought of a lifetime of bathtimes and bedtimes, figuring out what to serve for dinner and coordinating playdates, seemed unbearably oppressive, like jumping into the pool wearing a backpack. Some Saturdays mid-morning, I would look at my watch and think, \How am I ever going to make it to bedtime?\


With our other children, I had weaned them, but not fully known it was coming until all of a sudden it was done, and I felt sad that I hadn't paid attention to the last time I nursed, since I felt it was an important transition for each of them as well as me.
What's your \something\? Those words and the title of her book came specifically from Robin's mom. According to Robin -- only you know what that something is. And what are you going to do from those life challenges. Everyone has a gift to help others through challenges.
While my phone may not have been pointed at my children quite as much, it was quite often still in my hand.
\They've eaten but THIS HOUSE!\ You'd never ever EVER chide. Your tolerance precedes you as you make your way inside. And though the place is wrecked (We loved we laughed we learned all day)\nYou greet us with your steadfast glow that At-Work Mama way.
As a school psychologist, it is my job it is to be on top of every troubling incident that occurs in the schools today. It's true that it appears there have been many incidences of violence in schools resulting in tragedy these past several months.

The discovery that there was a term to apply to my need for times of quiet was freeing. I realized that those choices that appeared selfish were actually vital to my performance as a mother, wife and friend.
It's the double-edged sword of parenting that your children are always watching you. What you say and do speaks volumes -- aim to be a positive example. Your kids will thank you. Eventually.
Admit it -- being a parent is wonderful. And also terrifying.

One day, when we look at old family photos, I hope this letter gives extra life to each picture, offering the finer details of your magnificent toddler souls and revealing a love that only got bigger, when no one thought that could even be possible.
Do you ever find yourself asking the BIG questions about life? Why am I here? How can I make a difference? Do you set your priorities accordingly? Do you find the answers change as your life unfolds?
I know there's some really bad stuff that goes along with having a child with autism.  But I'm also aware that there's an abundance of gratitude, support, grace, hope, happiness, acceptance and love in our life thanks, in part, to autism.
Kids who have a head start stay ahead of the game throughout their academic careers. Parents can contribute to bridging the word gap by actively engaging their infants and toddlers in literacy-boosting interactions.
The hardest part about dinner used to be choosing what to eat. Now it's choosing whether to change your children's clothes to the ones that can be thrown away afterward -- or just stripping the kids naked to throw directly into the shower when it's all over.
I remember bursting with excitement to get a break from boring homework, cranky teachers, chaotic classrooms and sticky cafeteria floors. Those were glorious days because I was a kid. Now that I'm an adult, spring break looks a whole lot different.
We have to eat to survive, but how we eat can determine if we will thrive or not, and schools have a tremendous opportunity to positively influence the lives and health of our children.
Call me optimistic but I feel like a mother's love has the power to do amazing things. The world must agree with me to some extent, otherwise, why would we go through such lengths to celebrate new life?
Making dinner with a toddler around is a lot like doing taxes

Most of us understand what happens when we lose a person close to us. We revisit the memories of our time together. We cry over the relationship we had and the future we have lost. When someone loses a child to stillbirth, that relationship didn't even have a chance to develop.
I have sat on both sides of the fence, and have developed a deep respect for both working and non-working mothers. My feelings towards both waver, depending on the day.

It was already a big night. I was able to stay up a little later than my three younger sisters. I was a cocky eight-year-old sitting on the vinyl couch in the lower floor of our tri-level watching The 10 Commandments.
Let's face it
My meltdowns are far worse for me than they are for you.
Having a baby is often one of the most pivotal developments in a woman's life. While the news may give you reason to celebrate, finding out that you are pregnant also means it's time to start thinking about the cost of maternity care -- and avoiding these mistakes that could land you with massive bills.
There are some really uncomfortable moments while raising kids. Those moments -- though they take years off our lives -- are to be expected. And we commiserate with each other, and we live through them.
How is it that a toddler who is known for being all over the place was so happy to be still and in the moment?
