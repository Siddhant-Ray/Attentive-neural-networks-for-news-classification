What gets lost in the strip routines of Magic Mike, the articles about body building, and the occult romance of True Blood is, perhaps, Joe Manganiello's most impressive characteristic

Only a select few musicians and musical groups and characters and contexts such as the Grateful Dead have had the capacity and creativity to initiate communitas in so many, so consistently, and with such tremendous transformative impact.
Earlier this year, we got out first look at Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden. Now, the first official trailer has arrived

Creative writing is easy, and anyone can do it. All you have to do is follow these simple steps.


Reader Guillermo M. asked me if it was true that the mask was discovered by Craven by accident in an abandoned house during the location scouting for the first Scream film. Did this iconic piece of horror film history really have such a spooky origin?
Amber Rose and Blac Chyna escorted each other to the BET Awards\u00a0on Sunday night. The buxom blonde besties made sure all eyes
Iggy Azalea doesn't seem too happy with Britney Spears over the success, or lack thereof, of their track, \Pretty Girls.\
ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL a Sundance breakout film this year just hit movie theaters in wide release. I got to sit down with the director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and actor Thomas Mann and discuss this gem of a movie. It's quirky, sophisticated, fun and wildly creative.
The truth is, coming from a wee country like Scotland, I never really thought having a career in \Hollywood\ was realistically attainable. I've always been ambitious, but that career path still seemed a bit fantastical.

Inside Out is a wall-to-wall wonder, good news for anyone who despaired that the animation studio, Pixar -- after numerous missteps -- had lost its mojo, and who, frankly, would've rejoiced in any glimmer of the ol' Pixar verve now.

We can probably expect an interlude between the next seasons of Who Do You Think You Are? and Finding Your Roots, and the duration of that lull will hinge largely on how PBS chooses to balance and accommodate the sometimes competing goals of content accuracy and viewer demand.

Hidden pearls exist in the world of movies, as well








Hidden pearls exist in the world of movies, as well
I interviewed Spanish actress Paz Vega in 2011 regarding her then-latest film, \Cat Run.\ An international sex symbol since the steamy drama \Sex and Lucia,\ Ms. Vega didn't disappoint with her appearance, although like most actors, she's far more petite in person that she appears on-screen.


Last week I was able to view a handful of the 81 films from 25 countries, at the five-day long AFI Docs festival that attracted filmmakers, national policy and opinion leaders, journalists and a large crowd of viewers to the 13th annual running of the event in the Washington DC area.






Suddenly surf, sand and fun are replaced with palatial mansions, dazzling jewelry, exotic cars and cocaine. And guns. And murder. A classic tale of innocence corrupted and good vs. evil, Escobar
There's something about Norwegian actor Nils Hognestad that melts me. Ever meet someone and you know they have something special, but you can't pinpoint it? Exactly. So now you know what, I mean who, is keeping me up at night!

This is my second year at the Nantucket Film Festival, and this will probably be my one dispatch, mostly because I'm having too much fun to take time to write about it.


As I read the reviews my heart sank. I loved Jurassic Park, and certainly the Hollywood machine was counting on that. But how could Steven Spielberg allow his reputation and legacy to be tarnished so?




\Max\ is a family film, and it is all about the dog. This movie follows in a long line of dog movies such as \Lassie,\ \A Dog of Flanders,\ \Old Yeller,\ \Rin Tin Tin\ and many, many more. When you place the camera squarely on a four footed hairy creature who barks then you know chances are good you have yourself a hit.


What does a smart and socially savvy comedy writer, actor, and producer like Seth MacFarlane do when he wants to say something relevant about the moral progress of humanity and deliver it to a large audience? Write it into the sequel of his wildly popular 2012 hit comedy film.

Testing the definitive outlines of storytelling while exploiting the spectral potential of cinema, a few recent movies about childhood achieve an illuminating balance.
On June 24, 2016, Independence Day
I'm writing because, like many others, I saw the love letter you penned to Apple in defense of \independent\ artists, everywhere. And what a well written and well thought-out letter it was.

I never had a problem identifying with Peter Parker because, even though he didn't look like me, the elements of his character transcended race; they were universal.
The score for Dexter is so popular all eight seasons have released individual soundtracks and Licht has performed the music in concert before live audiences
Many of the most recognizable fictional characters in pop culture actually had real-life inspirations.


More than just laying down sonic wallpaper, Horner found a way to make even larger-than-life scenarios seem human, and relatable, and real. As a result, his music became instantly recognizable even to those folks who didn't normally pay attention to that stuff.





After repressing several urges to walk out during the screening of Inside Out, I stayed until the conclusion.  Alas, this is an overrated film directed by Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen that is confusing.
My family moved to Georgia from Vermont when I was seven, in late 1971. It was quite a culture shock as both my parents were ultra-liberal poodle kissing bed wetters. Then, in early 1972, after several months without a TV, we got a nineteen inch black and white Curtis Mathes.
When I saw Brook Soso fall apart on Season 3 of Netflix's Orange is the New Black, I knew exactly what was happening to her. I know, because like Soso's character, I've also been locked in an institution and forced to deal with mental illness without the support that I needed.
The realization that two such brilliant minds -- the brightest of their generation -- could allow personal hatred and the burning desire to win at all costs completely derail any semblance of useful debate is the real heartbreak of Best of Enemies.




This is a nation knowing the consequences, and keeping those guns around anyway. With guns readily available, everyone's fate is as random as Russian roulette. For the chilling toll, watch Requiem for the Dead on HBO, airing on June 22.






Khalil's film doesn't deal with the Netanyahu and Hamas of the conflict, instead choosing the human side of the struggle. When a very small group of Palestinian Carmelite nuns and a family of Jewish settlers \collide\ together through a car crash outside the convent, they then need each others' cooperation to get away from one another as soon as possible.







In a time of great social strife and growing inequality and public outcry, it's no wonder Peter Joseph's work has gained more and more prominence in the counter-culture each year. Love him or hate him, Joseph continues to challenge the \zeitgeist\, leading the charge towards a new society.

Kate Winslet in a smart ponytail and slinky black skimmer posed for selfies with fans as I approached MoMA this week for the New York premiere screening of her new film, A Little Chaos, directed by Alan Rickman.
On the evening I ventured into Central Park, to the Delacorte Theater for the always delightful experience of seeing Shakespeare under the night sky, rain was in the forecast.



After deciding himself to \enter the family business\ as a child, honing his skills reciting his great uncle's texts, Reda stayed busy on the stage as well, making his film debut in the internationally-lauded A Prophet in 2009.

There are some great running elements in the show, like Willis' fixation on his \Robe And Slippers Cruise\ promotion that proves to be his undoing, and his escalating feud with the station manager. There's a passing resemblance to Steve Coogan's Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge BBC TV series from 1994, but this is a whole new treat for the podcasting medium.









Nick enters the men's hotel suite and they murder him.  Actually they only glare at him but it's emotionally similar.  The men make fun of him for pursuing his \16th minute of fame,\ which is pretty amusing.

Kurt Cobain's raspy vocals seemed to bellow from the depths of some bottomless lamentful chasm. His music was sodden with a kind of relatable torment, and at times adorned with a beautiful mourning so honest and distinctive that it could never be replicated.



And I'm not talking about Avenue Q or Hand to God or the various Muppet movies or anything else in which the idea of the puppet is as much a part of the joke as anything else.























In film, music is a highly emotive force that resonates through spectators emotional strings like the plucking of a harp. It can send chills, celebrate triumph, inspire romance and evoke sadness. What is even more powerful than the music itself is its creator.


It was one of those \frozen-slowed-car-crash-uh-oh\ kind of moments... I passed within a foot or two of him, not wanting to make a big deal out of it, trying to respect his privacy, but all the same probably staring at him all the while.


I interviewed actress Joely Richardson on the patio of the Chateau Marmont in 2005. She had just wrapped her third season of FX's Nip/Tuck, which we discussed at length, among other things.
It is easy to be swallowed by sellouts and pop icons, but Tetra has achieved true success through honesty, authenticity, talent and a beauty that is outside of and within her. Tetra is a musical pioneer that is keeping the power of the female voice conscious and awake.

Yanna Avis is a magical person blessed with equal parts physical beauty and inner beauty. The kind of woman who reminds you of an elegance that has been lost in modern society but a kindness and intelligence that is very much present.

It was particularly disheartening to witness the absence of Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron as the historically significant first all-female team to break through and write the Tony winner for Best Musical
The manic energy that Verhoeven is renowned for was evident throughout our chat, and was infectious. By the time our all-too-brief lunch was over, I found myself waving my hands while I spoke in rapid clips, and using more bounce than usual in my stride.
In a movie culture of ever bigger, louder, and emptier booms, and a celebrity culture of relentless panty flashes and nip slips, Mr. Lee always reminds us of elegance, of discipline, of presence. With Christopher Lee in a production, there was never any need for lame camera-shaking and ADD cutting -- he held you.

There are thousands of film festivals in the world. A festival for every flavor of filmmaking from features, shorts, animation, horror, women, wildlife, documentaries and even for films featuring moustaches. Each one's vying for eyeballs. There are just a handful of fests that are considered important.
Just like creating a film, putting together a multiple day live music event is a collaborative art form. With music festivals on the rise, it was only a matter of time before they combined forces to form a one-of-a-kind co-creative super festival.
Porn is Bad. It's an old, tired narrative about the business, but it's safe for the press. So what if some porn stars criticize your review? That's much more manageable that criticism from the entirety of the flyover states, or worse, your editor, a little closer to home.
The release of the new biographical drama \Love & Mercy\ got me thinking back a bit. During my time at Venice Magazine I was lucky enough to meet and interview most of my heroes from the world of film.



As powerless as the wrongly accused may feel in the internet age, there are ways that those of us concerned about stories like this can exploit technology. We can share news reports of vindication such as the one involving Ancier and Neuman.

Good television is like a drug; you get wrapped up in it and it offers an incredible high. I get why people binge watch, and I'd really like to become one of them. The problem is, I know my limits, and I fear my lack of self-control.
This ongoing column series looks at some of the art that generatively confused us in recent months because it was, for a change, metamodern rather than discretely Modern or postmodern.
Out in the Night, a POV documentary airing June 22nd on PBS, reminds us that countless others in the LGBTQ/gender non-conforming communities still face discrimination daily.
Even the rain could not stop our need to worship live music. While Mendi's Beach stage had sand, and therefore the driest dance floor, the Bend and Meadow stages did not. Donning plastic rain-ponchos in a vivid array of colors, people danced beneath the falling water as the mud became deeper and goopier.

Do you ever find yourself unable to make a decision?  Vacillating between two, three or even more choices? Each choice we make takes us down a road, or further down the road that we are on, and you want to make sure it's the right road!

Boosie Badazz is an interesting figure in hip-hop. A rapper originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he has amassed a following in some areas where he can sell out entire arenas alone.
We scream, you scream, and apparently we all, piglets included, scream for ice cream! During a hot summer day, Max DiNatale decided to treat his mini pig named Pickle to a sweet dessert. When he came back with a vanilla ice cream cone, Pickle was snoozing in his little bed.
Hooray for Hollywood now refers more to the past than the present. The movie capital has in inferiority complex when it compares itself to prior glories.
Last year, the artist also known as Garrett Dutton released a record with the original members of his famed trio G. Love and Special Sauce for the first time in a decade. And this month, he begins a summer tour including both solo and full band shows.









Most of Chagall-Malevich centers on the time Chagall was Commissariat of the Academy of Modern Art, 1917-18. While the story is set against historic events, it makes no claim of historic accuracy, which becomes obvious fairly quickly. There's a kitsch yet wonderful fantasy quality about the story.




Ronnie Gilbert, an original member of the legendary folk group, the Weavers, died today (June 7) at the age of 88. While the prodigiously talented Pete Seeger was clearly the most noted member of the group (Fred Hellerman and Lee Hays were the other two members), it was Ronnie Gilbert who gave the Weavers their lyrical elegance.


Entourage is a movie made for the fans of the popular HBO series of the same name. For those, like me, who never saw an episode this is a movie full of mystery. What is the basis for the plot; who are these actors; and more than that who are these characters and why should audiences care about them. I
Just a few days before this year's Festival de Cannes, those of us who watch, love and write about Arab cinema received a press release from Abu Dhabi that seemed like just another announcement.



The ensuing dialogue is like intellectual groping, quintessential LaBute, as the characters Doug and Beth go from philosophizing about their night together to deciding what to do about it in a mere 70 minutes.



The Hunger Games was supposed to be fiction, but maybe it was prophetic. Now comes The Briefcase, CBS's new reality show that pits desperate middle-class families against each other for financial survival.


When the National Geographic Society channel, NatGeo, announced that the American Genius series would include Wright vs. Curtiss (the original title), it created a buzz amongst the aeronautically-minded.




Drake and The Black Keys are among the headliners for this year's Governors Ball, which invades Randall's Island Park\u00a0nestled in the East River between Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. A three-day, round-trip ferry pass between Manhattan and the park costs $55, and a three-day pass for round-trip shuttle rides between Randall's Island and Brooklyn costs $65.









For all the colors of Inside Out's assaulting ad campaign, you might suppose this is just another Day-Glo kid flick, but it turns out to also be a mind-bending thinker along the lines of The Matrix, whoa!
Music festival season is officially upon us! There are close to 50 music festivals happening throughout the summer and early fall which can make it challenging to decide which festival to attend.


Well, the whole thing was completely secret, for years and years and years.   So it was something you were doing where you couldn't tell anyone. We were totally paranoid about security--it was an all-cash business-- and the casinos could throw you out at any time - so it was all hush hush. From the beginning in 1979, I never talked about it publicly  until after the movie came out in 2008.

Vera Brittain's Testament of Youth, the famed memoir of the author's time as a nurse during World War I, is now a major motion picture perfectly poised for summer. Leave it to David Heyman, the producer of the Harry Potter films, to put this book on screen.




I love an underdog. In fact, I love everything about an underdog. From the wonderful journey of how they got here to how happy they are to just be in the room/arena/stadium with their highly-favored competition.

Brad Everett Young is a mixture of excited, tired, and a little overwhelmed. The Los Angeles based photographer has been awake for over 24 hours. Why you ask? Young was invited to photograph the after-party of the musical \Cruel Intentions.\

The National Geographic Channel is known for high-quality nature shows, nonfiction programs and factual documentaries, including those with a focus on history. Some 74 percent of all households in the US with televisions have NatGeo available for viewing.













Once, after he'd walked out on the Beatles, he returned to find that George Harrison had covered his drum set in flowers.










Pat Boone was among the many white artists of the 1950s and '60s who built their careers recording songs originally performed by black Rhythm & Blues artists. Tonight, he responds to criticisms that he and other white singers profited much more than the African American musicians whose songs they covered.

Imagine telling my teenage self that if I was very patient, when I'm in my late 30s, I would meet the idols of my youth. Duran Duran

Upon reflection, it turns out I've been looking forward to Tomorrowland more than I've been looking forward to any actual tomorrows. Which is ironic, because that is pretty much what this film -- directed by Brad Bird, who co-scripted with Damon Lindelof -- is about.



Pugs are insanely hilarious, especially when they are caught off guard on camera. Although, when this tiny pug in particular spots the family taping him... it's lights, camera, and action -- and boy is it funny!



If my dad or mom calls me after 11 p.m., my first thought is not emergency, but that one of them just found either Bob Dylan or Neil Young on TV. We Daleys are a proud Dylan-and-Young-loving people.



Buffy's new new album Power In The Blood starts off with the remake of your classic \It's My Way.\ By kicking off the album with this track, was she making a statement about her creative approach this time out?
Two years ago Stuart Edge got his start making videos when he left his well-paying but dirty job of cleaning porta potties for an internship at an agency that specialized in Youtube videos.

The concept of what propels an artist leaves us with a mystery. Regimented as it may seem at times, McMurtry's work has a meaning and an order. At 53, he has no deep, philosophical connection of his destiny. He plays music.
It was not over. In fact, it had not even begun. I walked up a loop of stairs to the top of the terrace, and saw a spread of brightly lit tables. A woman was singing. A young long-red-haired man was beaming and greeting guests.

Joachim Trier's intriguing Louder Than Bombs opens with  the birth of a baby, an ecstatic young mother and a thrilled young father


I interviewed Helen Mirren for Venice Magazine in 2005. Like most of the male population, she had given me palpitations of the heart and brain since childhood, my own introduction to her unique brand of elegant, brainy sexiness occurring with John Boorman's Excalibur, in 1981
Like so many, I am mourning the loss of actress, comedian and writer, Anne Meara. Partnered in every sense of the word with Jerry Stiller, her husband of 61 years, she brought smiles to all of us, but there was so much more to her career than many of us appreciated.


Well, here I am, once again hanging alone around the perimeter while the vast majority of critics and fans are having a veritable orgy of delight over Mad Max













What is most enjoyable in the movie is the Americana kitsch and the setting, filmed from a foreigner's perspective

An unusual entry in the Cannes Fortnight, Embrace of the Serpent is a stark black-and-white journey down the Amazon in the 1900s, based on the travel journals of German Koch-Grunberg and the American explorer, Richard Evans Schultes.
Still a bit to go until the Palme d'Or and Un Certain Regard prizes are announced in Cannes, and speculations are aplenty regarding the winners. Some say the festival was devoid of great works of art, others complained about the Festival de Cannes typical bureaucracy.










Tim Roth gives an outstanding performance in Michel Franco's new film Chronic, which just premiered at Cannes, as a male nurse who bizarrely goes beyond the call of duty to care for his dying patients.
Shows like \Orange Is the New Black\ (OITNB) and investigative documentaries like Diane Sawyer's \A Nation of Women Behind Bars\ highlight life in lockdown and have opened up a national conversation about the lives and treatment of female prisoners.

Other than with Sunset Boulevard, who needs flashbacks? Anyway, these ineptly constructed scenes were possibly added afterwards when it was realized test audiences had no idea what they were viewing.


Jia Zhangke's Mountains May Depart, a three-act movie beginning in 1999 and ending in 2025, seems very light in the first act.


Thank you Matthew Weiner, for creating a world that we could luxuriate in and learn from. And thank you for ending it on a largely optimistic note. These days, we need every ounce of hope we can get.



People love this guy.


If you want a spectacular score to accompany your British drama series, then look no further than John Lunn, the maestro behind the music for Grantchester, Little Dorrit, The White Queen, Shetland and Downton Abbey.

It has been the talk of the web the past week, as dear Sansa, tragic Sansa, victimized Sansa -- was just put through the grinder. Yet again. Damn, that was a hard scene to watch, and one I'm sure I'll never watch again.
OK, I'll admit it. I'll admit that I was skeptical when I heard about the \remake\ of Mad Max. I enjoy powerful and happy nostalgia for the giddy \I-don't-give-a-flying-f\ exuberance of the first two movies.
Meg Parsont, an occasional guest star on David Letterman's original NBC program, is momentarily stumped when asked how she'd advise the talk-show host to fill his retirement years after his last late-night show airs on CBS on Wednesday.
Amid all the tributes to David Letterman, as his talk show comes to an end tonight, I wish that at least someone on a national scale would have tracked down a clip from the 1979 TV movie, Fast Friends.





No one is more surprised to find Marc Maron sitting securely atop a tidy little media empire than Maron himself. As his self-titled series on the IFC channel, Maron, enters its third season, there's a marked fork in the path between the fortunes of Marc Maron, the TV character, and Marc Maron, the actor who portrays him.
Simeon Goodson should be a household name in comedy. He's been performing in various New York City clubs, bars, and anywhere really since 2004, and his effortless delivery matched with his unique laid-back observational humor. It'll come.
A new music biopic was featured at the AARP Movies for Grown-Ups Film Festival in Miami. The movie delves deeply into the troubled life of Brian Wilson, the creative genius behind The Beach Boys, from a compassionate and compelling point of view.
I was scared of Mad Men for a long time. Even as it racked up Emmys and accolades, I wouldn't watch. I'd lived through Happy Days and other treacly tributes to the '50s and '60s that didn't ring anything like true. They'd glossed over or just plain avoided the ugly stuff I'd lived through as a black girl growing up in that very white world.

I guess it is old-fashioned to call it that, but \Where Hope Grows\ is an old-fashioned kind of movie in that it harkens back to a time where movies promoted positive values.
\David, sir, let's talk about all things Purple.\
In the early evening of May 20 the words \used to be\ will be grafted to the end of my name. I will be referred to as \the former director\ of Late Show With David Letterman. Along with the name change, comes the surrender of an all-access pass to New York City.

I never saw B.B. King perform live or ever met him in person, yet I carry with me a lesson that he taught me many years ago. What B.B. taught me is that it is not so much talent that lifts us up, but rather it is the story of our \inner man\ and character that ultimately defines us.
I'm here to say \Thank You, David Letterman.\ More importantly perhaps, I want you (David) to know how much I've learned from you over the many years of watching your late night zaniness.




Nanni Moretti's latest film Mia Madre  is a solid emotional voyage into what it means to face a  parent's imminent death.  Margherita Buy plays a film director who is making a movie about striking workers in a factory while her beloved mother (played with great dignity by theater actress Giulia Lazzarini) begins her descent to death.
Any film that begins with a philosophy professor, played by Joaquin Phoenix, cruising in the bright sunlight musing to himself about Kant's  \unanswerable\ questions is going to charm me immediately. Indeed, Woody Allen's Irrational Man, which just premiered at Cannes, is a sunny joy to watch, despite its sinister subject:
Looking back, it's hard to believe what we did on those boards as kids.  What was exhilarating then now looks downright scary to me.  We didn't realize at the time that we were being pioneers.  We just loved skateboarding, and the more difficult the challenge, the more we liked it!
Katharine McPhee's divorce from ex-husband Nick Cokas may have been messy, but the two seem friendlier than ever. They were spotted getting breakfast together last week, and Nick even caressed her face during the meal.




Elle King grew up in southern Ohio but was made for Gulf Shores -- and the Hangout festival. The singer-songwriter whose full-length album debut Love Stuff was released last year, now lives in New York, likes to party, frolic in the ocean and speak without a net.

Sunday Night on ABC. And because Billboard rules in the chart world, here are my Top Ten Reasons To Watch our show.





I can't say anything more than others have about B.B. King. Except perhaps that my mother loved her \Blues Boy\ more than any other musician in the world. They were both from Mississippi, for one thing. But there was a whole lot more to it than that.



This spot the next several days will feature upcoming artists who were performing at the 2015 Hangout festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama, from May 15-17.  It kicks off with Zella Day, a 20-year-old singer-songwriter from Pinetop, Arizona, who now resides in Los Angeles.






A new documentary, \Don't Think I've Forgotten,\ revisits Cambodia's rock and roll scene.
\Ok, soo I grew up in San Diego, CA and attended a private school. I got into music in my early teens. I started recording myself singing and playing instruments with my tape recorder. \
First let's assume you mean could it fly here on Earth in our atmosphere. Anything can fly in space in zero gravity with the right propulsion on it, even a brick.
\The choices you make determine your future,\ Messiah Harris, 15, calmly attested. Sitting in a white-metal lawn chair, the son of Grammy-award winning Atlanta rapper T.I. reflected on the message of his first film Sons 2 The Grave.

Good news for Comingsoon.net's Joshua Starnes. He can recycle his critique of Pitch Perfect (2012) for its sequel
In the early to mid 2000s the hip-hop group Nappy Roots out of Kentucky were unstoppable. They put out hit after hit with songs like \Awnaw\ and \Po'Folks\, and did not seem like there would be any end to it.
It happened here
There are no easy laughs in The D Train. This humor is earned the hard way... cutting into character and peeling back the skin. The character Black creates, Dan Landsman, is the undistinguished, forgettable nebbish who has never left his hometown.

When she teamed up with ESPN Films to executive produce Versus, a new shorts series, Longoria longed to tell this boy's story. The result is Go, Sebastien, Go.
Herbert Bail Orchestra is a fusion of past and present, frontier and adventure, psyche and soul. Full sounds and powerful live performances pull listeners into their timeless dimension. With 6 core members and several guest musicians, they are truly an orchestral experience.

Here is a wonderful, heartwarming story of how a friend and I helped to be of service to someone who died long ago, to get his music out from beyond the grave and thus fulfill a piece of our own destinies.
As they say The Song Remains the Same, and in this case, it's true even 15 years between albums for Full Devil Jacket. Valley of Bones, the long-delayed, very-much-appreciated follow-up to the band's 2000 acclaimed debut album, picks up where the first one left off.
The good girl exudes grace, politeness, sincerity and intelligence to make a positive, lasting impression when encountering prominent people.
As happens so often in life, writer/director Rajeev Nirmalakhandan fell into creating a movie named The Odd Way Home quite by accident. A colleague who'd been engaged to produce a film on autism was unable, so she suggested it to him.
Is the media suddenly realizing that there are people who were born before 1945 who are still very much alive? And that there's whole bunch of them? According to the 2010 census, if I read Wikipedia correctly, the figure clocks in at 28,282,721.










Music has developed a close relationship with technology. The birth of the electronic era has changed how music is heard and experienced. The technological age has made it possible for one person to create powerful music that once required a team. Now, though an unlikely pairing, even video games are joining the music world.
Sometimes you get a movie with a silly premise, and all the information about the movie makes it look like a dud. Then you see the movie and the chemistry between the two leads is so good it almost makes the movie worthwhile. Note I said almost.




Beautiful souls swinging their tangled tendrils, orbs of fire tracing invisible geometry, rumbling bass that vibrates your innards, Palo Santo arousing olfactory bliss, and artists caressing canvases with their paintbrushes.

Her debut guest is comedian and writer Frank Conniff and, along with co-host/board op Lauren Hennessey, the trio makes their way hilariously through the kind of technical glitches and awkwardness almost every podcast is prone to in the early going.
MoMA's Titus I theater looked like a gathering for New York filmmakers and artists on Monday night

What a solid almost ending to this season. I'm always a huge fan of contemplative Alicia (can we say \Mind's Eye?\)






With a music career spanning five decades, Boz Scaggs has produced a rich catalog of songs that stretches across multiple genres. His 1976 breakthrough album, Silk Degrees, went multi-platinum and spawned a number of hits, including \Lido Shuffle\ and the GRAMMY-winning \Lowdown.\


I was pleasantly surprised to discover (actually its been around since 1977) Federal Way's Centerstage Theatre and its recent world premier production of the musical For All That.
Hollywood has given us a bundle of fuzzy, heartwarming moments celebrating the joys of motherhood -- many more than could ever be included in one single listicle! So, here's just a few old school classics that will make you appreciate your own mom even more this Mother's Day holiday weekend!

According to what's being reported on the Internet, it's a done deal.  The Fox network is cancelling Backstrom (starring the brilliant Rainn Wilson).  To fans of the show, this is shattering news.

Montage of Heck may help viewers see beyond the Cobain myth. That myth, however, has had enormous staying power, and partly because it resonates within rock history.


It seems I just recently reviewed Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast but I'm doing it again so soon because I simply couldn't resist his latest offering.

If you like horror movies, then you are going to love this one. It is smart, timely and well-acted.

Candice is a talker! Her meaty answers forced me to break this up into a two-parter. I must say, if I'm going to be forced into something, I'm glad it was by Candice! How do you like that pic she took just for this interview?!
The superhero show of my youth was Super Friends, where the extent of the violence was tricking someone to slip on a banana peel. This show seemed a bit more age-appropriate for my four-year old, so I ordered \The All-New Super Friends Hour.\
Hunter Miles is dead, and also immortal. This is the spirit, but not the heart, of Tumbledown, a rare new movie that had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival last week.

\The Gods of Rock wouldn't let it rain on The Who,\ shouted a voice in the crowd fleeing an afternoon storm at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. And They didn't -- the sun broke through by late afternoon, and The Who had the chance to sing \Talkin' Bout My Generation.\
The movie follows \little boy's\ path to faith and shows how it affects the entire town. This is done in a way that is not maudlin, but heart-warming. If it causes tears to flow, well that is the nature of the circumstances, and not a cheap way to wrest emotion from the audience.

Certainly the pedigree of Child 44 makes it seem promising.\u00a0But the timing of the release -- April, a pre-summer graveyard -- and the fact that it wasn't screened for critics until shortly before opening both mitigate against it.

The directing debut of actor Chris Messina, Alex of Venice is as notable for what it doesn't do as for what it does.

It's great discovering new entries to Podcastland, particularly those that push the boundaries of what we get to hear.

The tragedy of King Draper is that now that he is \ready\ (as he tells \Di\), the tough new girl in his life reveals that she is not. She needs to suffer a bit more for her past misdeeds.

It wasn't until  Game of Thrones was aired on HBO that the names began to have an influence on American baby naming. In honor of the new season, presented below are the most surprising names to show up on the Social Security Administration's list of U.S. baby names.




It is so unusual for a Greenway film to have a narrative story that frankly it is hard to know how to react to this sensuous tale. Are we to identify with the main character, Eisenstein, and truly care about his amorous evolution?  Or are we to take the love story as a pretext to enjoy a montage of fantastic  images about sex and death?

So much scandal these days! This week opened with a very \Good Wife\-y montage of Alicia being interviewed by an evil journalist who wants to take her down. The email leak breaks and we see that it won't be an easy ride for Saint Alicia. Especially because there are some steamy emails between her and Will in the dump.

Musical alchemist, Michal Menert, has been reshaping the world of electronic music. No longer bound by the two genres of house and techno, this underground Renaissance is changing the way critics interpret electronic music.
She was the first woman to include risqu\u00e9 material in her act. She wasn't \The Last of the Red Hot Mamas\... she was the first. She promoted and taught classes for young women who wanted to become Red Hot Mamas, too. Everything she did was original... she was one of the first jazz singers... certainly the first of the white jazz singers.
n depicting the events of John and Effie's marriage, the movie is quite reserved and beautifully nuanced. Many of the filmmakers come from Merchant Ivory Productions, and Effie Gray is very much in that tradition. It's hard to know with certainty what went on in the marriage, but there are letters and written accounts that served as source material.

If you didn't pay for music in the year 2000, I'd think you were the coolest person around. But you don't pay for music in 2015? You're just being an a**hole.

Finn, despite being adorable and buying her a video game, has a new girlfriend. Her campaign manager is leaving, having done a job well-done. And Peter? He is very, very low in my book.

Someone from the local paper was in attendance and wrote an extensive story on the incident.

Not sure about this one.  Kevin Hart is terrific.  Will Ferrell starts broad while setting up plot, but his performance is forced.  Whereas Hart, who plays it straight, is a delight.
Karen Pittman has stolen so many scenes, she should've been locked up years ago. I mean that figuratively, and man that opening line, which is still going on by the way, was pretty lame.

Looking back at my gymnastics career, the thing that I miss the most is to be able to perform in front of a crowd and Dancing with the Stars really takes me back to the competition days as the show has given me the opportunity to be able to do that again.

With her bad blonde wig and safety pins holding her imitation leather boots, Roberts still dazzles us with her earthy, warm, and self-deprecating Vivian 25 years on. While 50 Shades of Grey has recently captured our attentions, it may be time to instead indulge in a Pretty Woman  couch session.

If you are already a fan of MerleFest, then you can skip to No. 1. For the uninitiated, however, MerleFest is the younger, Eastern cousin of the Telluride Bluegrass Festival.

The microcosmic music festival has become a staple in the Los Angeles underground. While music festivals are welcome to all, they are not necessarily accessible for all.

The editing last week was something else. And while she works out her career, an eviction suit coming from Canning, and some leftover parenting issues, the best part is when she remembers Will.

Seymour Bernstein at 88 is such a loveable man, and so talented an interpreter of classical music, it is easy to fall in love with him.

The return viewer to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel might wonder if the unexpected and considerable box office gold of the original film can be struck again and, indeed, if the aging British boomers in the film can also find a second coming in their golden years. And therein lies the heart of both movies, namely taking a lucid and kindly look at aging.

Spock was my guy





The most important person in a reality television star's life is their entertainment attorney, at least in the beginning. Later on, when you're famous, you'll have agents, managers and other people holding your hand.

It's the chance to kiss on a turning point as the magical minute marks both happy endings and new beginnings with a brush of the lips. That kiss can be consequential. It can be a movie kiss.
Obviously the origin of music taste is a complex and intriguing topic. One of which no hard science exists (none that I have ever heard of anyway). Yet music is a part of all cultures and all people.



I am certain that there are a few comedy writers out there who would love to see their name in the credits, but have no idea how to get there. In the spirit of sharing, here are a few highlights from my many conversations with producer Marlinda Walcott.
When House of Cards returns February 27 for Season 3, I won't be in it. Not that I didn't try. My big chance came last summer, when I spied an ad for extras and day players, who might have a tiny role just for a day.
Who is Anthony Cumia? If your answer was simply \fired co-host of The Opie and Anthony Show,\ you'd be living in the dark ages.

Linehan lets loose in \Beautiful Songs,\ showcasing her identity as a confident and powerful singer. These are not songs Linehan is singing in homage; they are songs she's hand selected to reinterpret through her personal, unique editorial lens.
Seats were chosen wisely as the film was sure to be a bonding experience with whomever you were near. As the final preview came to an end the excited and nervous chatter quieted, the lights fell dark and the movie began.
Getting old and forgetting things, especially with busy lives and children, is normal. It's the realization when you begin to lose part of your vibrant self that Moore captures so poignantly.
Why are so many acceptance speeches so dull? As a linguist, I suspect it's the grammar -- the rules dictating their composition. That awardees are supposed to get to the stage and speechify in under a minute means that this grammar doesn't have many moving parts.
We open in Bali because why the F not.  We see Chris in a few outfits consisting of differently colored pastel shirts, at least four different hues, coupled with either shorts or khakis.  No, five different pastels.
We finally finally finally had a number of acceptance speeches that tackled cultural issues that we are facing. Finally the acceptance speeches reflected us and what we are all going through, collectively.













Eastwood is doing nothing new in seeking our identification with Bradley Cooper's Chris Kyle -- by aligning our vision with his, the director is involving us in the moral calculus and emotional burdens that come with the decision to take a life.
\I think it's so ludicrous, and so frivolous, and so mindless... that it has merit.\ That was shrewd venture capitalist Kevin O'Leary talking about the Gold Rush Nugget Bucket, a fun way to pan for treasure. Though he could have been talking about any number of products on the market.



On this day in 1843, Kierkegaard published his first book, the voluminous double volume \Either/Or.\ It was an epic argument for something beyond the law of identity.
Music has the power to reach far and wide, speak every language, and even control our pulse. Of the many genres of music that exist, hip hop has always been at the root of urban culture. It has undergone evolutions of change, but certain sensibilities have stuck with hip hop from the days of its origins to now.


Fifty years ago, Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger, arguably the greatest James Bond theme of all, and one of the most explosive musical compositions in the history of cinema missed winning the Academy Award for Best Song -- in fact, it missed a nomination altogether.

Because of his war pictures and Westerns, he will always be perceived by some as the heir to John Wayne, but, whatever one thinks of American Sniper, Eastwood is much more subtle than some jingoistic zealot.

Having your product in a gift bag starts at $1200, being there in person to be able to talk to celebrities or nominees starts at $5000 and shoots northward depending on your display size and position.


J. K. Simmons' music teacher from hell may earn him an Oscar, but he is also having an unanticipated nightmare effect on anyone who has had rigorous training, no matter what the field. We've seen movies about cordon bleu culinary school. Can cooking school really be as severe as the blood-letting in Whiplash?












It's often been said, \There's nothing like a Grateful Dead concert.\ While that's certainly true, there is also nothing like a Hot Tuna concert. Unlike Dead Heads, Tuna Fans tend to be more rowdy and aggressive, less \Peace and Love, man\ and more likely to scream out \Hot Fuckin Tuna\ to regularly startle everybody.
I made it to the 8:20 a.m. showing of, \The Last Five Years,\ and loved it. Nothing like a musical to start the day, not to mention, transport you to New York City via the story of a struggling actress, played by Anna Kendrick, newly married to the \It\ author of the moment, played by Jeremy Jordan.
Erotica, control and curiosity are played out against the glamorous International Style backdrop of Christian Grey's bachelor pad in the E. L. James mega-trilogy turned blockbuster film Fifty Shades of Grey.

Only Hollywood would turn sadomasochism, a complicated sexual performance, into a white college girl's extracurricular activity. And only whiteness would allow for the whipping to be seen as elective in a coming-of-age narrative rather than as unavoidable in the violent history of slavery.

Two Americans are dead and one is on trial for murder. I see so much pain and suffering. One of our most decorated soldiers was shot dead by another American soldier. Worse, it happened as he was trying to help another in his time of need.
John Fugelsang should replace Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. Now that Jon Stewart of The Daily Show is planning to leave, there is much speculation as to who will take his place. For my money, John Fugelsang stands out as the best choice.


Sports movies starring Kevin Costner




Often the case at the Academy Awards, pressure makes a cameo appearance that derails an Academy Award-winning performance -- a mental lapse, a stumble on the way to the podium, an incoherent ramble.
If 2014 was any indication of her mainstream success, 2015 will be even more rewarding for Ariana Grande.
As the film so ably shows us, it's not just that she's beautiful when she's angry... it's that she's beautiful when she's out in the streets, fighting for her rights, struggling to make the world a better place.


Valentine's Day 2015 saw the silver screen light up with the cinematic adaptation of this literary phenomenon. I, for one, couldn't wait. Watching the book's critics blow a gasket and spin out is always good for a chuckle or two.
The near-term fate of Leslie Bibb and Rachel Dratch, and the rest of the crew who made \Salem Rogers

These hosts are under persistent pressure, fueled by the necessary narcissism and vast salaries, to promote themselves as world-historical personalities -- making themselves players in great events, albeit leavened by (a stagey) self-deprecation.
In the Danish capitol, parents regularly leave their children in strollers on the sidewalk and go inside to shop. Thousands of bicycles sit out on the street at night with nothing more than a wheel lock. It's not that there's nothing to fear. The Danes simply refuse to be afraid.
The success of Marvel's approach to filmmaking, which is both dynamic and formulaic, has allowed them the creative liberty to explore their lesser known properties on the large screen. DC Comics, however, is still trying to catch up.
We are at a place in time when fellow artists can raise one another up and sponsor one another into an age of creative freedom. And in the future ahead, what we have to look forward to, as a community, is a new wave of creative expression.

The MovieFilm gang is back, and just in time to tackle last week's big news that Sony and Disney have come to an agreement to share Spider-Man.




A great character involves us in a way that most plots can't. Even the greatest of plots with a thin character doesn't involve us, but a great character with a thin plot does. It's all about character.








Do not read on if you have not seen Season 11, Episode 10 of ABC's Grey's Anatomy, titled \All I Could Do Was Cry.\

















The following is taken from the soon-to-be published (hopefully anyway) humor book Ho Ho Hoax! written by Jon Chattman and Rich Tarantino

All in all, the trilogy was entertaining, mindless reading, but I did find it to be a ridiculously insulting depiction of a modern, healthy female and relationship.  I'm not condemning you if you read the books as a guilty pleasure or if you go see and enjoy the movie. (I'll wait until it comes to Netflix.)
Top (pronounced [z\u026a\u02d0 z\u026a\u02d0 top]) is an American rock band that formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band comprises guitarist



As the flower child of Greg Brown, one of Iowa's forefathers of folk, Pieta has grown into her own as a roots artist since beginning a budding career with the release of her first record in 2002.

Stewart took the reins of The Daily Show as a goofy parody of local news, and turned it into something smart, influential and useful. It transcended mere entertainment. And it has done its job.

When James Bond rebooted with Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, the blend of old-school spy tale and modern-action sensibility seemed right -- if still a little restrained. Imagine now what would happen if James Bond were put in the hands of someone who was willing to not just rethink the secret-agent film but blow it up all together.




The injustice of women trapped in unhappy marriages by husbands who refuse to let them go has long been acknowledged in religious Jewish communities. If a woman cannot get a \gett,\ she is not officially divorced, and therefore is not free to remarry.



\Sometimes we are sitting around the house, and I'll say to Marilyn, 'You know, we need to get out more, see more people. Young people!\  And she'll say, 'Okay. Let's do that.'  But, we never do!  I guess we are pretty content with ourselves.\


With the premiere of Fifty Shades the movie widely anticipated this Valentine's Day, I think it's important to look at what heterosexual men can learn about what women are seeking in the fantasy that is Christian Grey.
I enjoyed Kristen Wiig's surprise appearance as Sia's stand in for \Chandelier,\ as Sia does not face the audience while singing. BTW, can Kristen Wiig be a stand in for me in all aspects of my life? Please and thank you.
We open with Kelsie having a fake panic attack while the other women gaze at her unmoved.  She is trying to make sure that Chris doesn't dump her after she insisted that Chris isn't going to dump her.  Kelsie looks sly and sneaky beneath her oxygen mask, which is no small feat.
Rock City's new project #WhatDreamsAreMadeOf is an homage to St. Thomas and their struggle. They hope their new project can narrate the stories many have overcome and still face, specifically growing up disadvantaged and in poverty.
Unfortunately for the filmmakers, the audience, and (given the $175 mil price tag) the studio, Jupiter Ascending isn't exactly the second coming they were hoping for. Instead, it's a melange of misplaced ambition that's asphyxiated by tangled plot threads that are at once overcooked and undernourished.




I sat up a little straighter, waiting to receive the inspirational words that would propel my career forward. He pointed to a brass coffee urn situated on the food table. \I don't take any sugar.\





Ariana Grande seems to be everywhere. She's got more singles out there than a J-Date mixer, just showed up on The Grammys, and I hear Starbucks will soon introduce the Ariana Grande-sized latte. OK, that last statement is a lame sense of humor, but let's face it the 20-something hottie is all over the place and deserves it.









It is Cindy's sense of priorities and work-life balance that makes her an example of truly exceptional living. The happily married mother of two has stated that if she must choose between her family and career, she chooses family--without hesitation.



The irrepressible Rosie O'Donnell could not help herself. Coaxed to do stand up on the not funny subject of her heart attack by HBO's Sheila Nevins, the television star created a routine that is more than the heartfelt in its title.
I'll admit it can take just one film to usually convince me to come to a film festival. In the case of this year's Berlinale, it was Jafar Panahi's Taxi. I knew I wanted to sit in that bursting at the seams press screening, first thing in the morning, to watch it. And, as is usually the case with my cinematic instinct, I was right.
Forever has a strong female lead, generally good scripts, and Gruffudd's opening and closing reflections are often thought-provoking. But I wonder if the fact that the show is based in fantasy has made the writers lose their grip on reality and decide that whatever they think needs to be real for the show is real.






Perhaps every list of the best albums of the year should be labeled \The Best Albums of the Year...That I've Listened To.\ This year, I've listened to more albums in a long time, thanks to extra driving on the highway, my favorite way to hear new music.
Tony-winning Lillias White (for her role as a prostitute in The Life), and recent recipient of the Bistro Award for her run at 54 Below, accompanies herself clapping palms, hitting hips, her beats syncopated with that powerhouse voice.

'In the case of Phoenix House, many HBO films do focus on addiction. We have all seen many young people succumb to peer pressure to try substances to escape reality. The need for escape seems great right now. '






With a wonderfully breezy writing style, Mr. Dickerson imparts newly uncovered history of one of the single most influential and culturally important items Mankind has ever devised... The Electric Guitar.

During Hollywood Week, a rabid base of Idol viewers cheered for Adam as he moved on to the next round with his rendition of 'Wicked Games'. Judge Harry Connick Jr. was heard saying, \I think he's a superstar... I think he's got something.\
So for anyone who thought the success of Common has come out of nowhere, please study the totality of his stellar career and his partnership with Derek. I realize what I'm requesting is odd in the world of tweets, sound bites and 24-hour news cycles. I promise you will be entertained.

Alas, I am here to save you all. I am obsessed with documentaries and I have seen a lot of the films available on Netflix. Below is a list of what I think are must see documentaries, as of January 2015.

It was during this conversation that I witnessed Spencer's eyes sparkle in a different way. For him, he knew that he had ability and some talent. He also knew he wasn't a prodigy. For Spencer, he came to understand that this mentor was talking about the layaway plan.

Monday was the anniversary of Alfred Lion's death in 1987. The founder of Blue Note - the greatest jazz label of all time - Lion produced some nine hundred records, including Thelonious Monk's first recordings.
Hailing from Camden in London, England, Wax on Water is Maya Fire - a songwriter,  multi-instrumentalist and singer who describes her music as 'Electro-grunge meets Industrial'.  The first single to be taken from the debut album is An Army. I spoke to her on the eve of the single's debut.




It was actually Marc Davis' masterful work on the Mistress of All Evil for Sleeping Beauty that led to his being assigned Cruella de Vil. But given that 101 Dalmatians was Walt Disney Animation Studios' first film to be set in a contemporary setting, well, Davis wanted Cruella to be a real departure from everything that he'd done with Maleficent. He wanted her to be the first modern-day Disney villain.
Jake Atlas, known as Thriftworks to the world, is traversing multiple musical dimensions boasting his unique sonic style. With new music pouring out of him like an unleashed dam, he has so much to share with eager eardrums.



The one thing we can be sure of is that it will come from some place unexpected and from no one we've ever heard of before. It just doesn't move along in nice, orderly ways. Like everybody else, I feel a lack of social commitment in young artists, but I'm not about to criticize them.
The new star vehicle for Kevin Costner \Black or White\ is, of course, both good and bad. The acting is generally good. The plotting and writing, generally not so much.
Envision Festival in Costa Rica is not your average festival and will therefore not have your average preparations. Whether this is your first Envision or your first music festival, it is important to be prepared for the equatorial environment of Costa Rica.

Electronic music is evolving from the soundtrack of a party to the soundtrack of a generation. Producer and DJ Michal Menert creates tracks that take you on a journey where a colorful story unfolds.


















Saturday Night Live became relevant again for about five minutes during Episode 13 of its 40th season. But it wasn't the writers or the cast that did it. It was D'Angelo.





Kevin Macdonald directed one of my absolute favorite movies of the last ten years, the twisty political thriller State of Play. As such, I was especially excited when I had opportunity to chat with the director about his latest project, Black Sea (now in theaters).

While it attempts some measure of high-minded resolution to the many complicated issues it raises, it's simply casting too wide a net to feel truly satisfying. In trying to be color blind, it just comes off as tone deaf.
What I think is so powerful about \Empire,\ which became the number one new show of the season, is that it is a perfect combination of many relevant social factors combined into one show that just happens to work.




Chatting with Donny Osmond, Melissa Manchester, Louise Goffin, Meitel and Rumer.


Twice in one show, the writers turned a fast-thinking, amazingly intelligent woman into the basic dumb female in a thriller.  All they left out was mindless shrieking, but they did still turn her into Olivia Dope.


Birdman is a feat of technical expertise in search of any real meaning.  Its deepest intention seems to be to make us admire Inarritu, and some of the awards the film has won suggest it may have succeeded in that purpose.
This Backstage Pass column will be a labor of love for me. You see, when I was fifteen I wore out a copy of Robin Trower's album, \Bridge of Sighs.\ I had a surfer friend of mine draw a windswept wave on the album sleeve, then recreate that on the wall of my bedroom. So when the 40th Anniversary tour for Bridge of Signs came along, I was all-in.


I make a point of knowing as little as possible about the films I see at the Sundance Film Festival (or any other film festival -- or just films in general, for that matter) before I see them because I want to see them with a blank slate.


After 25 years in New York, I must admit I'd never stopped to think about the people who work Christmas tree stands. Never, that is, until I saw Christmas, Again, Charles Poekel's debut feature film, borne of a perhaps unprecedented dedication to research.

Shortly before his tragic death, we had the great fortune to interview American sniper Chris Kyle.  His brutal honesty and unwavering sense of good and evil were remarkable, and at times haunting, and remain with us to this day.
DeLonge's departure, as well as how abruptly it occurred (and how publicly it was announced by his scorned bandmates), may have seemed surprising, but in reality the latest Blink-182 hiatus was not hard to see coming. Here's why.


Consider this -- two of the best performances of the year center around the smallest of movements, the quietest asides, the slightest shift of the eye.  I'm talking about Bradley Cooper in American Sniper and Julianne Moore in Still Alice .





Now, the master of horror who -- along with the early Japanese video games -- informed a generation's appreciation of electronic, moody soundtracks has released a full record of music.





The reason Dewey Decibel's rhymes go hard in the paint is because the MC is always equipped with a brush. The main draw of the video for \Cappuccino\ - from his upcoming A Different Drum EP - is to see the creations of the Philadelphia rapper/illustrator in live action.










American Sniper is well on its way to being the biggest war film ever at the domestic box office, and second most popular R-rated film ever behind The Passion of the Christ.






One could have, perhaps, predicted the glut of pop culture-oriented podcasts that have sprung up. Hell, it's the linchpin for the recently launched WolfPop network of shows. Less understandable (at least to me) is the rise of the trivia-oriented podcast. Especially trivia AND comedy.

With the boom in self-released, Netflix and HBO comedy specials, it sometimes seems there's too much of a glut of comedians unveiling their new shows. LIke the comedy club craze of the 1980s, it's leading to plenty of entertainment options for comedy fans -- but hardly all of the work is first-rate or particularly original.

Let me start by agreeing with the critics of American Sniper on one point.  The movie does present Iraqis in a one-dimensional way and doesn't spend much time trying to understand the complexities of the war. Yet the fuss over the film is still ridiculously overblown.



In my opinion, Chris Kyle was a hero, regardless of what his politics were, how many un-PC adjectives he might have used, or the fact that he fought in a war that I didn't agree with.
Nothing is simply as it seems in Duality (it tends to be more), and while of course the path of a young man in search of self is one of storytelling's ancient and universal motifs, it's brought to life (or


The hardest battles are not fault in the streets of Iraq or in the poppy fields of Afghanistan, but instead they are fought far from the front line back on the homefront.
\Hannah Montana\ star Miley Cyrus just listed her family's Los Angeles home for $5.995 million. The six-bedroom, 6.5-bathroom abode is in the affluent area of Toluca Lake and was designed by famed architect Bob Easton.
I see soldier worship as harmful because it so easily morphs into support for wars, no matter how unjust, by letting our affection for our fellow citizens in uniform and our desire to see them come home alive obscure the truth behind what they're supposedly fighting and dying for, which is rarely as black and white as we are told or wish it to be.







Members of the Dimestore Prophets include Ray Glover, who plays guitar and sings, John Wilson on drums, and Eric Groff on bass.  And there's a distinct party vibe to their musicianship.  Obviously, they enjoy what they're doing and do it well.







As the festival community grows, so does our reach. The mind can reach further than the hand or any man made cord. This evening at the Gem and Jam Pre-Party reminded me to unplug, reach out and connect with my fellow humans.

Thursday morning when I learned the Academy's list of nominees, I spent the rest of the day alternating between despair and rage. In fact, I have loved movies unabashedly since I was 18 months old and my mother took me to see my first feature.









Despite a few narrative bumps -- including a not-all-that necessary b-plot about a mad bomber -- the film, directed by the twin Spierig Brothers, is handsomely mounted and nicely told. So what got the film shunted to the armpit of the release year?


















They don't make them like that anymore. The First Lady of Arab cinema and its Golden Age, legend Faten Hamama, is gone, leaving a rich heritage that helped turn her country, Egypt, into a Hollywood on the Nile.



\Now he belongs to the ages,\ was my first thought when I got the call that my friend Andra\u00e9 Crouch had succumbed to the heart attack that felled him the week before. As grandiose as it may sound, he was a musical giant who may one day be fully appreciated in death in ways that sometimes eluded him in life.

In the light of last week's tragic massacre in the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, I wanted to see how a news-oriented comedy podcast would handle the event.


There was some heartening news over the holidays for those of us who are longtime Star Trek fans. And there was some alarming news, none of which has been mitigated since.






The doc offers numerous firsthand accounts of what it takes to get a TV show on the air and features a backstory that is almost as equally fascinating. Director Des Doyle and Co-Producer Ryan Patrick McGuffey, both natives of Ireland, sat down recently to discuss the arduous journey.










We've now had months of delightful Oscar speculation
The genre of electronic music has vastly evolved since the early days of techno. It is no longer simply an underground phenomenon but now a trusted method of production spanning almost every style of music.

For the first time, Sheryl Crow has scored a musical, and the result is a sold-out show for seven weeks. As I read the review, I battled conflicting emotions
Currently residing in Los Angeles, Jackie is a part of the EDM Renaissance that is emerging from the West Coast. She draws from an infinite well of inspiration by surrounding herself with otherworldly muses.

Identity has become such an important part of the musician's lifestyle that it can sometimes supersede the music itself. The image of the rock star or the super star DJ is inundating our psyches through social media, billboards, advertisements, radio, television and film.


Should you see the movie \Selma,\ or should you avoid it because people claim LBJ gets a bad rap? I admit I was skeptical first, being an LBJ fan, but chose to watch the movie to see for myself.












Why are Canadian based web series and shows taking a stand more than US prime time network shows?



















The world would not be the same without them. I think we should focus on understanding and supporting these people rather than ostracizing and mocking them.\ That said, here are some of the best films dealing with Asperger's
At the recruiting office, they give him a brochure for the Seals... and we soon see Chris in basic training. \We're looking for warriors, not quitters.\ Training is brutal but Chris makes it to sniper school, where his \hell of a gift\ sets him apart.
The writing on this show is brisk and subtle. Plus there are some hilarious actions and reactions from the cast. They enhance the scripts which are already good to begin with. Each episode has at least a couple of laugh out loud moments.










Why did Sony decide to produce such a satirical, comedy about North Korea and its leader?  That will be my perpetual question as stereotyping continues within the western world against Asians. This Orientalism and the concept that the East is weak, feminine, and seeking domination need to be eliminated from western mindset.
Whether these factual films are sticking to the facts or not, the emotional stories being told are being told brilliantly. We need to celebrate this.









I will show my children Avatar
Now I'm not recommending that you affix a feminine hygiene product to your iPad when you're on your way to meet a prospective collaborator. This was something that happened quite inadvertently.
Max Charles has a resume longer than his arm. This confident young man is not only adorable, but a pleasure to interview!
I've realized balance is probably something that DJs need more than people with normal jobs, sunlit ones where you can just eat a Chop't salad at your desk and hit Soul Cycle after your last meeting of the day. A DJ's cubicle is everyone's party, and that's not a workspace where balance is easy to achieve.
I sat down with Jessica Fellowes, author of three juicy coffee table books about the award-winning series and niece to show creator Julian Fellowes, to get the inside scoop about the new season.

As to Cocteau's assertion, I was reminded of it over the weekend when our consistently \artistic\ friend, Madonna found herself embroiled in yet another controversy.



It's a film that came upon us at the end of the year, but with word of mouth and lots of significant award nominations, including a recent win as Best Picture by the National Board of Review, it will probably attain the audience it deserves in the months ahead.
I interview Ryan Phillippe, director and star of the self-satirizing thrillerCatch Hell, about Clint Eastwood, why you should never sleep with a cop's girlfriend, why comedians get away with murder, and why hedge fund people don't care that you're a movie star.


Films are evolving thanks to visionary artists -- seems like just yesterday Dorothy was stunned by technicolor. Time for the Academy to dust off their bones and realize it.

















There is no more quintessential product of 1960s movie culture than the James Bond franchise, and Goldfinger is the film that shot the series into the stratosphere of global entertainment.

Here are 10 things to keep in mind while setting your goals, ambitions, and dreams for the year, provided by the Billboard Top 10 Hot 100 Songs of 2014.






We all aspire to do great things this new year but sometimes we need that extra inspiration. Whether you're starting new, going through a tough time, or are somewhere in between, here are five songs to get you in the right mood for this new year.









On a positive tip, Michael Keaton made a comeback, U2 released one of their best albums in decades (don't hate), and Chris Pratt became a movie star. On a downside, we lost way too many talented people this year from Robin Williams to Joan Rivers to Philip Seymour Hoffman.



One of the reasons I attend Americana music festivals is for the opportunity to be exposed to new music and musicians I might never have sampled on my own.








It's a clich\u00e9 of the season to list award favorites, but it is also a thrill to be able to recommend so many good films.

Recently I caught up with Snoop Dogg to find out how he likes to celebrate New Years Eve. I fully expected his reply to be \Gin and Juice\ and perhaps with a twist. He completely surprised me.
American actors are not always the first choices to play the most American of characters. And while I love those from abroad, I don't want all my favorite roles taken from them.


How should we judge former President Lyndon Johnson based on the newly released and widely acclaimed movie Selma? Was he a reluctant, foot-dragging politician, or one of its heroes?
There is a lot to like in Into the Woods but there is also a lot more that should have been better. If the playfulness and emotions inherent in Sondheim's songs had been delivered, the movie would not have been just good -- it would have been great.






Between last episode and this one, The Interview went from a planned wide release to a cancelled release to a limited release to an online release. Phew!


The good news on Tuesday afternoon from Sony Pictures does not, however, end the fight. Not in the least. Now it is time for two more very important things to happen.
I don't mean to suggest that problems of systemic racism can be solved in a movie theater. But I do think that sharing observations about the casting of our movies is a great place to start.
Ridley Scott is no Cecil B. DeMille. That's not necessarily a bad thing. What it means is that Scott's new epic Exodus
I have also recently viewed the movie in its entirety. It was not the final cut, but it was done enough for me to offer some thoughts about why this may be one of the most important films to be released in a while.
Get ready everyone. Christina Milian, her mom, Carmen, and sisters, hair stylist, Danielle and, Cordon Bleu Chef Lizzy are getting ready to give the Kardashian's a run for the their money.
What could possibly go wrong?  An American movie about assassinating the leader of a nation which the U.S. had branded as part of the international axis of evil. The assassination movie is launched from a country with a long and shameful history of involvement.
Film's promise for Roeg remains undimmed and unplumbed in its ability to thus mediate different \realities\ -- \Perhaps we are not the creatures we think we are.\
Into the Woods has long been one of my favorite musicals.  The first hour of the movie version is a near-perfect adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's work.








Evidently the real dangers to society are those at the top of the social hierarchy, those whom appear to be innocuous and hide in plain sight. As current events have shown, this is a woefully true observation.





Jubilant Plaza employees added big red letters spelling out \Freedom Prevails\ to their marquee, then took to the Internet to share the news. Or, rather, they would have taken to the Internet.



Bernhard tells us she lost her mother Jeanette this year. She mentions this in wistful passing, wondering what mom was doing while teenage Sandra was locked in her room listening to Laura Nyro. This quiet moment shows how she keeps the intimacy alive.






I've been in love with Into the Woods for years.  I've seen it performed several times, watched the DVD of the original Broadway production many times, and lost count of how often I've listened to the original cast album.

I give my thoughts on how Jackson wraps up this prequel tale in my review for Jim Freund's Hour of the Wolf, and also give my verdict on the much more engaging, Irish animated fantasy, Song of the Sea.


But their newest, Two Days, One Night, pulled me in almost instantly and held me to its gripping conclusion. It's a small story -- an individual's fight for her economic life and that of her family in the suburbs of Liege, Belgium.
Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods arrives on the big screen 27 years after it opened on Broadway -- and with the same second-act problems that have plagued it through the years.










After more than 60  years in the entertainment business Australian housewife turned entertainment superstar Dame Edna Everage is truly in a category all her own.
The reality is that we veterans come home to our families, neighbors and communities who, while grateful, also expect us to pick up where we left off. So where do we go from here? Here are some idea-starters...


As The Interview's release date approached, theaters received retaliatory threats. In response, major theater chains cancelled their showings and Sony dropped its plans for a Christmas Day release. This decision brought on cries of censorship.

Of course it is a bad idea for a film distributor to be intimidated into not showing a film because of blackmail or threats. But it is also important not to make a fetish of the form of freedom to the point that we can't see and respond ethically to the moral substance of what is being produced.

Ava DuVernay's Selma could be subtitled \behind the scenes of a hagiography.\ Apart from the stock footage of The famous march from Selma to Montgomery it's not cinema verite in the style of say The Battle of Algiers.
It's tempting to try to find something complimentary to say about The Interview.  Surely any film that draws attention in any manner to the horrors of life in North Korea can't be all bad, right? Unfortunately, even such a film can indeed be all bad.




And given that 'Maleficent' is now the highest grossing live-action film that Angelina Jolie has ever starred in, it's clear that these late-in-the-game changes that Robert Stromberg, Joe Roth and John Lee Hancock did right by that A-lister. Though Peter Capaldi has a very different opinion.


An engaging presence, Slaughter is also a smart and passionate advocate for the issues she subtly raises in her books. Here's Slaughter talking about the genuine dangers female cops faced when joining the police force in the face of hostile male resistance.

Personally, I love Christmas, Christmas music, Christmas TV specials, and most of all Christmas vacation. So while I'm otherwise on mine, here are my top 12 Christmas songs for this year.
So how did Seth and Joel go about choosing the holiday songs that would be featured on this recording? Given that MacFarlane has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the great American songbook, McNeeley opted to let Seth choose the line-up for this Christmas album.

Hosts Mark Steines and Cristina Ferrare talk with guests about improving their lives starting at home. It's not just a topic they promote on their show, but one they believe in off camera as well. Just listen to what the holidays are all about to them.

What I remember about Joe was that he scared me at first glance. You've seen him in Woodstock, with that spastic stance that makes you wonder, \'What's up with this guy?\

On Friday night three artists who all rightfully could have headlined such a show came together to play a benefit for the beloved CSUN radio station KCSN 88.5 Los Angeles.
In all our concern for \free speech\ (a phrase that has been tossed around needlessly; the United States government did not censor The Interview), we've overlooked the people of North Korea, and how our American thirst for comedy erases them from our consciousness.








There is an eerie vibe about the movie \Foxcatcher\ from its first moments to its last. It is hard to pinpoint what it is but the sterile bleakness of the opening scenes sets a tone that stays with the movie and the main three characters who inhabit this story.

The idea of Important differs from Best






Here are 6 TV-themed gifts guaranteed to get better ratings with the tube-obsessed types in your life than the most highly anticipated series premiere (if you can bear to give them away).

Annie is not as bad as you feared it would be but not as good as you hoped it would be. As long as the camera is on Wallis it is a delight but when she is not the focus the proceedings come to a halt. So keep your eyes and your interest on her and you will have a good time.
Since, she turned 25 years old this year (Happy birthday, girl), we decided to compile a list of her top 25 greatest songs of all time. This was no easy task because all of her songs are so amazing. But we eventually came up with a list.

Mr. Turner, directed by Mike Leigh, is by no means a coherent biography, but a gorgeous riveting film that presents brief, often unconnected excerpts from the latter years of the great British painter William Turner.

A glittering metropolis like Manhattan has many, many confectionary delights at Christmastime but one of the best is Jane Siberry's Holiday Hoes and Hosers show this week at Broadway's Iridium Jazz Club.






The people over at Disney Interactive have employed Anna and Elsa for another important adventure -- to teach kids to code.
I'm not saying Moses looked like modern-day Egyptians or was black like some folks attest. No one knows that. Still, just given history and migration patterns, I think the one color that can be effectively ruled out is pasty white (e.g., Christian Bale).

THE SHARP THINGS is a longstanding, multi-member NYC-based collective led by singer/songwriter/pianist Perry Serpa. With the December 2nd release of their EP Adventurer's Inn, I spoke with Perry about the collective and his career as a music publicist.

As you've probably already heard, Disney Parks and Resorts go kind of Christmas Crazy this time of year with character-specific decorations giving each land at the Parks an especially festive feel for the holiday season. But what you may not have heard is that Disney Infinity fans are now also embracing the spirit of the season.


\Ascension\ is a new mini-series on the Syfy Channel that shows a lot of promise. It is a story about a manned spaceship on a one hundred year journey to a new planet, that is also a murder mystery. Both facets of the show are interesting and so you get the best of both worlds.
Usually, when you play \Whatever Happened To...?\ it's with some washed-up celebrity. You track the downward career spiral of a Max Baer Jr, a Johnny Whittaker, a Kim Kardashian (not yet, but one day, one day), and get a concentrated lesson in the impermanence of fame.



Bill Condon, aware of the controversy surrounding Side Show in its original production -- is it P.C. to focus on \freaks\-- said he is hoping for the day when reviews won't open with a comparison to its ill-fated first production. And now this production is meeting an ill fate all its own.

The guests that pass through the portals of Bullseye with Jesse Thorn run the gamut of show business and the conversations can get serious. Still, given the host's comedy connections, no one would debate that his show counts as a comedy podcast.


Well, the Golden Globe nominations are out, and as usual, some things don't make sense. But I suppose that's the fun of it, yes?

Ultimately, each time we go to the movies, we, the audience, make a choice for better or worse cinema. We make a decision that influences what gets made, what gets produced, what is distributed and shown.


Top Five does provide an in-depth look at a comedian trying for something new. It strives to make it real and believable, and it succeeds for the most part. The problem is the entertainment factor gets left by the wayside.



When asked why I love Mr. Buddy Guy so much, I respond, \Because he's always smiling and making me laugh! How can you NOT like a man like that?\ What kind of person would you be?

As someone who always preferred Joan to Kathy, I will not be watching the upcoming episodes of \Fashion Police.\ No one can ever replace Joan Rivers. She was a fashion icon and a comedic legend, and for fans like me, the decision to replace Joan with Kathy does not sit well.



In the end, Peter Pan Live! was, in my opinion, a missed opportunity and low on fairy dust.







Is there really such a thing as a coincidence? Or is there something in life, working behind the scenes to bring every story together? I did not set out to answer this question. I just followed my fascination with a strange and beautiful story from China, about twin sisters surprisingly reunited by a red dress.
As the mother of three children who were born with a rare medical condition called facial paralysis, as well as other physical challenges, I know first hand the importance of a smile in a child's life and the life of their family.

He won the landmark Supreme Court case striking down life sentences for juveniles, just one issue he details in Just Mercy

The Discovery Channel special, Eaten Alive, was hyped up quite a bit leading up to Sunday night's airing. It is not a show a snake lover would watch, but I felt very compelled to.


I had never been invited to dine with royalty before I arrived at the Marrakech International Film Festival. Sundance, you've got a lot to live up to.
The story of The Double is a parable of how people can get caught up in the hamster wheel of modern existence -- cowed by authority, hierarchy, and external standards of worth into trying to please everyone around them, while not pleasing the most important person they have to live with
Reese Witherspoon bares her heart, soul and body in the new film \Wild.\ She tackles the role of Cheryl Strayed with gusto and determination and lets herself become totally absorbed. This is not the \sweet little Reese\ we have known and loved in other movies.








As the era of people buying and owning discs comes to an end, the studios are finally making some classic shows available for purchase while they still can. Here's a look at some of the best. Keep in mind, every boxed set tends to have a torturous history.
You have to give AMC credit for a cable network rolling out a continuing unique entertainment experience. And of its current five dramas, both The Walking Dead and Hell on Wheels had ushered in surprising changes to their storyline characters this year.
I love to discover a thread between the real world and the movies. Particularly if that connection pushes humanity to do better and accommodates my ongoing personal agenda to heal and unite, while watching one inspiring film at a time.

Owing to a web of legal rights so complex it could have been knotted by one of Bond's diabolical nemeses, the official 007 series hasn't been able to use the character of iconic cat-stroking supervillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld since 1971's Diamonds are Forever.

I was 20 years old at the time and I remember, quite vividly, having a feeling of recognition mixed with aspiration.


\Rapper's Delight\ was the song for which Sugar Hill Gang became famous and it featured one of the first examples of sampling (Chic's \Good Times\ threaded though the track) that was also a harbinger of the appropriation frenzy that would infect the art world at the same time.



I've spent half a century watching films that are by, for, and about men. I've paid too much of my hard-earned money supporting a fantasy world where half the human population has gone missing.
Today we think of the 1970s as the heyday of the conspiracy thriller, but the reality is that the conspiracy genre flourished a decade earlier, before most of the disillusionment. And it did so in large part at the encouragement of none other than the President of the United States.

Alicia's finally owning her campaign and starting to accept the fact that she wants this. We see her stand up to Peter and his philandering ways. It's only been five years and she finally has a reason, and the guts, to tell him to shut up and get a hold of himself.























This year the Ajyal Youth Film Festival, in its second edition, is going to be phenomenal, mark my words.

For this episode, Parvez and I are joined by Rabia Chaudry, an attorney and civil rights activist who is a family friend of Adnan Syed and first brought this case to the attention of Sarah Koenig, the reporter behind Serial. Listen in to hear Rabia discuss her history with Adnan, her thoughts on what she's heard on the show thus far, and the other work she's engaged in.

To describe Labour of Love would prove a personal labor in futility. But what I can say is that it is a film richly shot, beautifully written and acted so organically, I simply felt overwhelmed by its message for days after viewing it.
It is a shocking film











Nashville may be known for its abundance of top quality country music, but many people don't realize that over the past several years, other musicians have made it their home, and they are changing the city for the better.
It seems Taylor Swift is everywhere these days except Nashville. The guy selling newspapers on the corner in the nation's capital listening to gospel tunes through his ear buds has heard her newest ditty \Shake It Off,\ even if it was a muffled version in a passing car.


Over sea bass and chardonnay, she talks about navigating the wild streets of Venice, a treasured daybed and her enviable skills with a fish knife.
In the early seventies I had the honor of dating Mike Nichols.  In no way is my remembrance meant to take away from the love he had for the fascinating and the cherished Diane Sawyer who also has been kind to me, but I feel sharing a historic moment about him is important and, sadly so, newsworthy.
Chris Botti








Last Friday night! I had the incredible experience of watching the first televised Hollywood Film Awards. Okay, there's \tacky\ and then there is \hopeless.\ The HFA was on the latter side.






As Hamlet is essentially a bloodbath, and as the Bard's tragedies always end with the protagonist dying, as a result of his own bad choices, one doesn't hold out much hope for anti-hero Jax, and others like his Machiavellian mother Gemma (Katey Sagal), surviving the bloodletting.
A mere month after releasing Warm Covers EP, J.D. McPherson is back with more

I saw Mona Fastvold's The Sleepwalker while at Sundance, which is available on VOD and at opening at New York's IFC Center November 21st. The film stars Gitta Witt, Christopher Abbott and Brady Corbet and Stephanie Ellis, all talented young actors worth being aware of.














Hence begins Peter Handke's play The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez, which played this week in Lisbon, for one night only, as a special event in the Lisbon-Estoril Film Festival.  Unusual for a film festival, this play was one of its extraordinary highlights.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines 'phenomenon' as an occurrence, perceived through the senses, the cause or explanation of which is in question. I cannot imagine a more fitting description for The Midtown Men and the exhilaration which both precedes and follows their every public appearance.

Most fans want to know more about their favorite music artists. Some songs can give fans a glance into the inner workings of a musician, but in the information age, many want to know more. What exactly do they want to know, though?











How long does it take a group of grown-ups to come up with a workable storyline for an 11-minute-long cartoon? Would you believe two days? So says Craig McCracken, the talent behind two Emmy-Award-winning Cartoon Network series.

Amelia gets outed as a recovering addict when some horrible woman recognizes her from NA. There was probably a better way to handle that, but the drama factor was upped 10 points. Derek jumps in -- not to save her, but to take the surgery, and maybe her job.

The Who's music/act was almost a weapon. They took the stage with something akin to an invasion/occupation. It was theirs now until they didn't want it anymore.

When I watch your show it makes me really sad sometimes. Your audience gets breakouts on their faces, gets bad hair cuts, looks bloated sometimes and some of them have wrinkles when they smile. It's all a part of having a whole, perfect and complete human body.





Here's the dilemma


There are basically two kinds of sci-fi films. One kind is the easily digestible. But not so Interstellar, which is the other kind of sci-fi film. For it's unconventional.

This captivating multi-media show is the brainchild of composer and director Kenji Williams, who fulfilled his own dream to bring us the unique vantage point of genuine NASA astronauts and how our world looks from their eyes.





Benedict Cumberbatch is not the first heartthrob whose wedding will evoke hysteria. Elvis Presley and Bollywood's own Rajesh Khanna evoked their share of delirium in far less hyper-connected times.
Not all megalomaniacs are preening, medal-bedecked-uniform-wearing, sociopathic assholes. Sometimes they're mousy, tatty, middle-class husbands with a basement full of electronic equipment and a murderous secret to hide.













You can't hear yourself think most lunch days at this popular outpost in the East and you might have to go all the way out to their Santa Monica version to do business. But, in any event, at Michaels, everybody is talking at once and not listening.
Finally! I don't like missing weeks of \Grey's Anatomy,\ especially when the other Shondaland creations get to run. I know it's the oldest of the bunch, but show a little respect, guys.
The talented, charismatic, popular Iraqi-Canadian rapper named The Narcicyst first appeared on my cultural radar in 2009 when I watched City of Life. In his latest short film, a senses-overload experience titled Rise, Alsalman explores his roots and his ability to step away to comment on them.

If I'd made a documentary film about the scars left on America through industrialization, instead of writing Ghosts of Tom Joad

















It sounds like an interesting challenge -- staging an authentic-looking zombie apocalypse while not scratching up any of Grizzly Creek Lodge's nice new furniture. But that's exactly what Jon Cooke has spent the past 5.5 weeks doing -- transforming this family-friendly area into a six-acre wide kill zone.

What do Robert DeNiro, Jason Mraz, First Lady Michelle Obama, David Beckham, Alicia Keys and Kofi Annan all have in common? They, along with hundreds of actors, politicians, athletes and rock stars have appeared on Sesame Street.
A break from the standard Halloween fare of mad slashers and paranormal infestations, the new film Horns brings a decidedly hometown slant to an examination of the good and evil that lives in all of us.




What better time than Halloween to look at the status of women in horror films? While a large percentage of the on-screen screams come from women who are getting sliced and diced, not many are behind the camera or writing the scripts.


Since he's a relatively youthful 45-year-old, it's genuinely hard to think of Hal Sparks as an elder statesman of broadcasting. But then again, given that Sparks booked his first professional TV hosting gig while still in high school, he's already got over a quarter-of-a-century of in-front-of-the-camera time under his belt.
Everyone wants to be remembered, you want to leave a lasting legacy that will resonate. With  Red Band Society you will laugh hard, love deeply, and you will run a gamut of emotions. No matter what, the characters and stories will always leave a mark on your heart, and your the way you view life.

One of the world's largest music festivals is coming to America for the first time, and they're bringing out the big guns.

It's hard to write something significant, and harder still to find the performer who can then make those ideas uniquely his own. Jake Gyllenhaal gives the performance of his career, and that's saying a lot in the overhyped world of Hollywood, but it is nonetheless true.

Clapton was God to some--or so the graffiti said back in the 60s. But for me, Jack Bruce,who passed away last week, was the soul of the show.

The TV comedian just sold his Los Angeles abode for $2,178,200 ... and it's apparently just as likable as he is!




Such success in less than five-year time is enough to earn some rest. But not for Rassi. Once again, the entrepreneur and his partners are ready to gamble. This time, with MADE Music.

In the record industry boom of the early 1970s, revenue from album sales was the mother lode. But the most effective way to break a new artist or take an existing act to the next level was the hit single.

At its core, The Last Ship poses a religious quest for redemption










On Valentine's Day, while en route to a \poetry reading about love\ by a group called Angels on Bicycles, I realized I was standing in front of the Hammersmith Odeon, where Kate Bush, one of my favorite singer-songwriters, had played her last concert in 1979.

So make a wish, trivia will make it like your birthday everyday.
I've had a few days to try and recover from that shocking ending to the latest episode of The Walking Dead, but I still get really uncomfortable every time I watch it. Let's not dig too deeply into the fact that I've insisted on rewatching \Strangers\ several times.
Everyone, at some point, wonders how they would react to a split-second emergency. Fight or flight? Leap into action or race for the exit? Or simply crumble?
To this day, New York City has no leads, nor does the FDNY.  Some experts suggest the real flag was misplaced at Ground Zero in the days after 9/11. All we know for sure is that the real flag came down from the flagpole the night of 9/11, and a different flag was raised 12 days later at Yankee Stadium.

Once there was fact, and then there was fiction, and finally along came something called reality TV to marry the two into some new, bastardized product one might just call bizzarotainment.

We have reached a pop culture-dominating existential crisis; reality stars are getting too big for their britches or for what any \15 minutes of fame\ should entail. I did not feel this way about Zach Rance, a contestant on this past season of Big Brother.
What transfixed me about Oscar as a high school shop girl in my home town of St. Louis still fascinates me today. He was the fashion Degas.




Lordie, lordie what an ex-hit man won't do for the love of his dog.  Keanu Reeves is back in this slam-bam-thank-you-mam kind of violent, IMAX, computer game film with witty dialogue.  As bloody as this film is, it is funny.


From the very beginning of my life's obsession with rock music and the people that make it, I have found the interview the most fun to read. It's almost always the most informative format, too.
Yes, this is a surreal movie experience which will leave you laughing, reeling and talking incessantly as you leave the theater. And that's what it's all about, isn't it?

Most of the time, a song gets stuck inside your head for hours, days courtesy of a catchy chorus or well-written verse. In the case of Bastille, however, their orca-whale-sized hit \Pompeii\ produced a mind gloriously filled with repeated \eh ohs.\

\Birdman\ encapsulates almost every classic male protagonist from Icarus through Faust, Charles Foster Kane, Willy Loman, Stanley Kowalski, Jake Gittes, Tony Montana... every man's dire quest to ultimately to be heard, be appreciated, and to be not just admired but loved.

Even at its rockiest, Glee has had a steadfast message that we are all underdogs, and there is nothing, and no one, we cannot be. There is nothing you can't accomplish with faith, hope, dreams, drive, and a special group of friends.
Have you heard of Tonya Cornelisse? Say whaaaaaat? Get with the program, people. Tonya has two film projects being released within five months of each other. Did I say two films? I meant FOUR films!
Tonight, I'm joined by Kristen Stewart who is continuing her commitment to independent films with her latest movie, Camp X-Ray, in which she delivers a strong, nuanced performance as a young, inexperienced MP assigned to Gitmo.
The story rushed headlong into all the hard questions revolving around love, death and what gives life meaning, but they were overlain with the pop culture vagaries that make everything and everyone seem shallow these days.


Unfortunately, given that Wilmer's post That '70s Show career has mostly been built around family-friendly fare like Handy Manny... Well, it was kind of hard to imagine how that preschool program could be used as fodder for a haunted house.


The popular sense of the early 1960s is that it was mostly a time of light and celebration which came to an abrupt end with the November 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. But the reality, as most Mad Men viewers know, is much more complex.

I will not even try to expound on the construction of this episode and how well they brought back Kate Burton, fit in the flashbacks, and made me feel sympathy for Meredith again. When was the last time you really felt for her, or like her?

Record World co-owner Sidmore Parnes was a man of his word and a man of few words. After abruptly firing his editor, Mitchell Fink, in the fall of 1972, Sid handed me the job, saying simply, \I assume you're prepared to take over the magazine.\ I was 23 and had worked there for a year and a half.




I still love listening to albums -- however threatened the album itself may be in today's music world. So from time to time I think, wouldn't it be nice to support musicians far and wide by sharing with you some of my own current pet sounds here -- the new music I'm listening to today?

I posted about New York Comic Con the other day, giving an insight into one of the largest Comic Cons in the world. This is a slide show of photos taken with my iPhone - just some of the antics that occurred this weekend in New York.











We see it as a beautiful mosaic, and you're really lucky when it all comes together and you walk back and all those little specks, that Seurat painting, when you step away from it, it all takes focus and becomes one beautiful thing.




I used to dream of being on Oprah, where she would help me find my birth mother and father.  I never wrote her a letter or anything, but I imagined it.

The idea that more will follow in Snowden's wake -- people who have knowledge of illegal and unconstitutional actions by the government stepping forward in a sober and responsible manner -- is surely sustaining to Snowden.
There's sometimes a common theme or recurring character that threads through a film festival.  This can be especially striking in a fest as tightly curated as the New York Film Festival.  Such convergences usually happen by accident, according to Kent Jones.

I was driving. We were in Florida...





So now Alicia has been goaded into most likely running for State's Attorney, thanks to a little Gloria Steinem cameo and the fact that Castro is a really dirty, horrid little man. Not only is he gross, but he eggs her on by bringing up Will.

Murray's shimmying in his seedy Sheepshead Bay kitchen, and singing to Dylan's \Shelter from the Storm,\ are some of the film's many highlights, but he has nothing on Naomi Watts' pole dancing with a baby bump.

Film audiences may flock to The Good Lie, a compelling drama because Reese Witherspoon is one of the stars, but they will fall in love with Arnold Oceng, Ger Duany, rapper Emmanuel Jal, and Kuoth Wiel.

I've been covering the New York Film Festival since 1987 and have, over the years, developed a bit of a love/hate relationship with it, as an institution (specifically, Film Society of Lincoln Center) and as a festival.

When movies do \talk to each other,\ says Kent Jones, \that's always great.\ Certainly it's fair to say that noir films, from Maps to the Stars, to Gone Girl, to Foxcatcher, dominate much of the conversation in the fest's 52nd edition.









It would be easy to dismiss The Good Lie as manipulative, a movie aimed at the tear ducts (and we all know you can't trust a movie about emotions).



On the last day of shooting Lily of the Feast, a feature set in 1970s Williamsburg, Troy Garity, in a suit, sits on the edge of a bathtub, counting. The L.A. based actor, son of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden, plays Santo Bastucci.

The release of Captain America

Miss me? After some time off, here (finally!) are some new releases on DVD and BluRay and the best of recent months that you really need.

Dr. Phil offers these tips for how to discipline your children.

I can't speak for everyone at tvtag, but I'm personally still coming to grips with the loss of my favorite non-Liar, Mona Vanderwaal.

This week, Jaymie and I discuss the death of one of our favorites and look ahead at what's to come on Pretty Little Liars.

It's over? Already? There are so many more artists to see, music to experience, moments to remember, Nashville sights to check out.






















The devaluation of music has also the devalued the listener. Maybe the problem with music isn't technology. Maybe it's us. Could it be that the music industry is sinking and fewer people are buying music -- not only because people don't want to pay for it, but because listening to music is now officially a lost art?




Albums are tricky things in today's world. Now, every track must be a hit, a single, a smash. These 12 songs are a lovely compilation of classics and standards, many covered by the woman who made them such, with new approaches and voices. The fact that Streisand even cares to record at 72 is amazing, and her voice remains equally as such.
Usually, MasterChef exaggerates

Tried to make you go learn trivia, so I said, \know, know, know.\


A standout at this year's Toronto is Foxcatcher by Bennett Miller.  Here's yet another feature based on a sensational true life story -- yet this mesmerizing film (which won Best Director for Miller at Cannes) engages on so many levels, it practically reinvents the genre and renders the whole question of reality-based or not moot.


Among the greatest of teachers, I personally hold Amos Gitai in a top position. His work -- such as his latest masterpiece Tsili -- is insightful, groundbreaking, thought-provoking, strong, full of emotions and always entertaining. The best example of cinema with a conscience.
Along with Glenn Close, Meryl Streep hosted a premiere screening this week of Israel Horovitz' My Old Lady at MoMA.

Football is the greatest of all sports because it is made for people that crave structure.  The Thursday Night Football games are the worst things to happen to people like us and when I say us, I guess the word \structure\ was a polite way to say the word anal.
Some people come into Show Business for all the wrong reasons. Their goal is just to become famous. This will not work. They're not really interested in any training or the acting process. They are trying to use the idea of acting to compensate for an invisible and disconnected life.

This is what I was waiting for all season. Total and complete chaos. I was sure we were stuck with Kevin in the woods and wondering what the heck the GR were doing laying out baby clothes.

The Legend of Korra did something that's hard for any television show to do. It satisfied an appetite for something I never knew I even wanted. Specifically, it created a role model
Loudon Wainwright
Joan Rivers was the ultimate survivor who snatched all opportunities and handled adversity without compromise.  She remained who she was always, resourcefully doing what was necessary, and doing it her way.
I admire Smith's impulse to expand his film-making palette and was a fan of his Red State. Tusk, however, may only be for Smith completists. It was so disheartening that I bailed a little early in order to make a screening of The Reach.


By Day 3 it's become clear that the Toronto film fest 2014 is above all about the year of the actor, male and female.  As I toggle between one theater and the next, I discover yet another film that raises the bar on the art of screen performance.

I first met Joan Rivers almost 50 years ago when I was a casting director working on The Swimmer starring Burt Lancaster. Most of the film took place in wealthy suburbia so the actors had to seem like upper class wasps.

No one missed the irony of a John Waters retrospective at The Walter Reade Theater across Lincoln Center's plaza from Fashion Week.

Every time I went to dinner in the ballroom that once belonged to J.P. Morgan's daughter, Joan would call for the waiters, cooks and kitchen staff to come out. She would thank them. And the guests would applaud. I never saw another New York hostess do that.

One way to determine who's better at something is to imagine the parties involved switching roles. Could Universal Pictures and Tokyo Drift director Darrel Franada team up and remake Citizen Kane?
Twigs' desire to not blend in is the kind of quality stars are made out of. Whether you call her alternative R&B, punk or electronic, FKA Twigs is the future. She is an artist we should all be watching closely even if she does become the next Mrs. Robert Pattinson.
Jaimoe
I had a chance to catch up with Lemper, who took a break from another recording session to talk about her passion for this latest project and excitement for the upcoming performances at 54 Below.
I'm still shocked at Pretty Little Liars midseason finale and trying to cope with the death of my favorite non-Liar.

While most girls dream of interviewing George Clooney, I have always wanted to sit across from actor Payman Maadi, from the Oscar-winning Iranian film A Separation.

Why should we pay cable companies big monthly fees for a huge lineup of programs we never watch but are charged for. Research shows that folks with 300 channels only watch an average of 12 of them. Why not pick and choose just what we want to watch and pay for each show as we go?  Or, as the industry calls it







Do you have what it takes to get what you want?

This week, the chicken comes before the egg, but the eggs are really, really, hard to cook.

In two weeks, we've had two films that want nothing more than to entertain us with some adrenaline-packed, fantastic storytelling. How each goes about the task, and how successful each is, says a lot about the filmmakers, how they regard this genre, and what they think of their audience.
So, why did Aubrey Plaza choose to do Life After Beth? And how did she find the tone of her crazy zombie character?
The actor's death should be a springboard for opening up the dialogue on what depression is really all about.

The episode may disappear quickly after I post this, but God I hope not. It needs to be seen and remembered today of all days when what we need most is a Robin Williams to make us laugh the way only he could.

There's been quite a fuss about a nationalistic, Russian beer commercial David Duchovny made not long ago -- especially given that he recently discovered that his roots are actually in Ukraine. For obvious reasons, this is less than ideal timing.
