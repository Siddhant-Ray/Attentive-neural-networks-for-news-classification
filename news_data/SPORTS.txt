Back in February, the NHL proudly announced that it ranked number 17 on the EPA's National Top 100 list of the largest users of green power. It became the first professional sports league ever to achieve this important distinction.
In many ways, Winston represents the perfect reputation zeitgeist for the NFL.  He's an awesome football player with perceived character issues.  That makes him less likable, and in the case of some Tampa Bay fans -- particularly women -- he hurts the overall experience.
The COO of the team said focus should be on cities like Baltimore are suffering, rather than ballpark protocols following the protests.

Trans visibility might be increasing in everyday society but this trend is not translating to the sports world in the same way it has for LGB players. Out-of-date policies have to be combated, dismantled and replaced with policies that respect transgender identities.
Not a good look.
Unreal.
Cheerleading requires serious discipline and more hours of hard work and training than most other collegiate sports. However, there's no glory, because when the cheer team takes the field or the floor, it is in support of the football or the basketball team. Thus, it requires a type of selflessness and humility that is rare in NCAA Division I collegiate athletes.
The NFL is clearly a professional league dominated by Christians. If Tebow is struggling, it isn't because he's \Tebowing\ or bowing down in prayer. It's because he's completing less than half of his passes.

Strong Inside is the story of Perry Wallace, who was the first African-American basketball player in the Southeastern Conference.  It's part sports book and part sociological case study. Maraniss is able to emotionally insert the reader into the middle of the country's civil rights movement of the late 1960s.
Egyptian-general-turned-president Abdel Fattah al Sisi's iron grip on dissident is likely to be put to the test with the sentencing to death of 11 soccer fans for involvement in a politically loaded football brawl three years ago that left 74 militant supporters of Al Ahli SC dead.
World soccer is about to get another taste of the global soccer's wheeling and dealing with the likely election of Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, the head of the Association of National Committees (ANOC), the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and the influential Solidarity Commission of the International Olympic Committee.

The outcome of the game was clearly not what he was hoping for, but his commanding presence on the field - Nick doing what he always does - could not have been a more appropriate way for him to honor his courageous sister's life.

Derrick Rose is back to doing Derrick Rose things.
O'Connor held the puck in his glove momentarily and then inexplicably dropped it between his legs, where it bounced in for the tying goal by Providence.

The president met the sprinter during a trip to Jamaica.
I can only speak for NASCAR, but car crashes are not in fact a big health risk for NASCAR drivers. Due to all the increased safety measures since the fatal crash that killed Dale Earnhardt in 2001, there has not been a driver fatality in a NASCAR race since 2001. Crashes are one of the least  hazardous aspects of the sport.
Wow.
SNL ridiculed the deeply flawed system that allows athletes to attend college and even receive degrees without receiving an education. We found the skit to be entertaining, but deeply disturbing. Putting academic integrity before athletic success shouldn't be a late night punchline.

Lost in all the hype of the spectacular college hoops matchup between Duke and Wisconsin on Monday night was the incredible outing by Oakland Athletics ace Sonny Gray, who very subtly took a no-hitter into the 8th inning against the Texas Rangers.
So in the absence of a clear formula or a defined timetable, and in the face of all this uncertainty and unpredictability, what can you do to keep yourself committed to your goals? Here are a few ideas.
Just kidding. They are all lowlights.
Coach K dismisses 'rent-a-player' criticism.
Champions like Tiger Woods are always charting and changing their course to be certain everything is on track. Tiger didn't just come to Augusta because it was the popular thing to do. He wouldn't have showed up if he wasn't ready to win. He came to win and he's prepared to win.
Suffice it to say, the new mandate hasn't made anybody happy and has garnered plenty of vocal detractors (and rightly so), from US Lacrosse, the sport's national governing body to coaches who don't see the flimsy headband approved by FHSAA as serving any purpose.
For it's first 80 years, females (including Rometty who showed up in pink) were denied the green jacket but allowed on the grounds during the tourney to \entertain clients.\ That sent a powerful message about women's true place -- not only in the business hierarchy, but society in general.

Tis the season of the bracket buster, the upset story, the Cinderella team. Tis the season when we turn on the TV rooting for no one and, in the final seconds, find ourselves shouting for a team we know nearly nothing about.
Three No. 1 seeds are still afloat and plenty of rich storylines exist. Along with Kentucky's pursuit of the perfect season, three remaining schools are within 350 miles of Indianapolis, allowing ticket prices on the secondary market to reach record-breaking highs in 2015.

The threat of SB 101 becoming law has thrust the NCAA into a unique position. The NCAA has an opportunity to have an impact beyond sport by speaking out against this discriminatory law.
Coach Harbaugh's multi-million dollar deal is just more proof that college sports are big business. It is another reason why college athletes, particularly college football players and basketball players, should be getting paid.

We have a problem with pacing in our society. And if baseball--as I've long hypothesized--is a microcosm and a metaphor for said society then it should come as no surprise that the pace of the game has been targeted as one of the biggest issues for fans.
This is the new reality of skiing and snowboarding. With a smartphone at the center, we have an integrated system of technology that tracks our runs, captures the experience with immersive detail.

My forehead throbbed with tension. It hurt to swallow and my eyelids were red, puffy and raw. I didn't care and let the tears out. They were extra salty as they combined with the sweat caked onto my face before landing at the corners of my mouth.
You know something I've never seen? I've never seen a referee or linesman who is \biased\ toward or against a particular team. I would say so if it was otherwise, and probably would have to be physically separated from the SOB if we were in the same place at the same time.

Don't expect to win any games, they said. Some of the boys have attention issues, they said; several chronically misbehave. Some lack \talent\ or are slow footed. And we think so and so is selling weed, and, oh, by the way, we don't think a woman should be coaching a boys' team in the first place. I had a different perspective.

When parents place their kids in organized sports early on, they start with the right reasons. They hope their kids become more physically fit. They often want their kids to meet friends or learn to be part of a team. But eventually their kids' participation in sports morphs into other motives.
Some players have retired; others were released, or were traded away. New faces dot the turf, in the form of free agent signings, prospects and other roster hopefuls. Perhaps no team is experiencing this dynamic more than the New York Yankees.

It will take more than a verbal statement to persuade either Iran of Saudi Arabia to lift restrictions on women's sports. To achieve that, Mr. Blatter would have to put a sufficiently high price tag on their failure to do so.


Let me try to explain why what you said was not an innocuous sound byte, but rather an offensive statement.  First, I do not have a lifestyle. I didn't choose my sexuality the same way you didn't choose yours. Second, being gay is not what defines me.

There is far more to Dean Smith's legacy than 879 basketball victories, an Olympic gold medal victory in 1976, two Division I National Championships and an astonishing 11 Final Four appearances. There is the far-from-simple virtue of a life well lived.

The Zurich Chess Challenge was a festive six-grandmaster extravaganza played this month in the posh Savoy hotel. The American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura benefitted from the last-minute change in the rules and blitzed his way to win the title.
Recent soccer-related racism highlights European nations' tortured transition from ethnically relatively homogeneous to multicultural immigration societies amid a resurgence of entrenched racial, including anti-Semitic, attitudes that flourish in times of economic crisis and are not limited to Muslim communities.
The National Football League and its clubs have been leaders in this process of exacting tribute from the cities where their game is played. It starts when a club makes a demand on a city or county to improve its stadium or else!  The \or else\ is always the threat to relocate its franchise to another city.
I have enjoyed a lifelong love affair with baseball. But as passionate as I am about our national pastime, there are some things that need to be changed. Here then is what I hate most about the game I truly Iove.
A man of passion.
While Stern's decree was intended to protect his own brand in a manner that would make Roger Goodell blush, the dress code has proven to be mutually beneficial. A rule that was so despised has spawned a new financial opportunity for the players.

The other night I put aside this pessimism as my eyes opened to some truly amazing stories of humanity in sports. If you want to see what is still great about athletes, just attend a local Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
\I don\u2019t know. I don't think Marshawn knows yet.\

Yes, fantasy football is much more than a game; it's a political science crash course. Now if we could just get more people to play together, then fantasy sports may help us bridge the world's political and diplomatic divide.
This is the same man who once called his teammate a \half n----r piece of sh-t.\

I believe every Olympic Games where athletes, spectators, journalists, and others from around the globe congregate for a hallowed two weeks is a testimony to miracle of humanity. I believe that people are inherently good unless some \neuro-circuitry\ misfires or is misguided.

He is in us, in the students--he is in our passion and our drive and our love and our character. We strive to achieve balance and success and good-valued morals and happiness in our lives.
Popovich's genius has been in his defiance of NBA wisdom. NBA wisdom holds that players can carry championship teams until they simply can't anymore, and when that time comes they should be let go.

Projecting an image of being politically and culturally on the cutting edge, the UAE carefully picks its battles. Participation in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, the jihadist group that controls a swath of Syria and Iraq, has projected the Emirates as a military force to be reckoned with. Soccer is the Emirates' next target.

For the most part, sport is about entertainment. Tennis matches, especially at night, are beginning to look and feel more and more like rock concerts. Right now, win or lose, Nick is adding to that experience in spades.
In this article I will start with stating why Rafael Nadal is my hero, why he should be all of ours, and why he is the greatest example in tennis today of prevailing against human suffering.
An empire, more often than not, doesn't erupt so much as erode. The \Big Four\, composed of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray, is no longer the force of nature it once was. But it happened quietly, subtly, the way water wears away at rock.
When you sit down to enjoy the Super Bowl, enjoy a healthy side of irony with your wings. In much of Europe, soccer embraces a rapacious form of capitalism that would make Mitt Romney blush, whereas in the U.S., the NFL eschews the blue and white heat of high finance for a philosophy that is tinged with more than a touch of red.

In what has seemed like an especially inane lead up to the Super Bowl, Marshawn-Lynch-Won't-Talk-Gate has been particularly annoying. Especially aggravating is the media's ongoing insistence that it is somehow doing athletes a huge favor by covering them, as opposed to, making their own livelihoods off the backs of those athletes.
During Perry's show, using either ShopTV or shop-enabled tweets sent out through the game, fans will be able to check out a variety of products being sold during the performance.  Upon finding something they want to buy, fans will complete the purchase from their couch by using Visa Checkout.

If you believe our country's psychics, the New England Patriots are about to win Super Bowl XLIX.

This year 184 million Americans will watch the Super Bowl and over 40 million will host a Super Bowl party. Below are ten interesting facts, not related to deflate-gate.
Americans probably like to think of their countrymen as a group of achievers, hardscrabble hustlers who pull themselves up by the bootstraps each morning to go to work, eat apple pie, and fall asleep watching baseball.
On Sunday night, either the Seahawks or Patriots will walk out of University of Phoenix Stadium as winners of Super Bowl XLIX.  Leading up to the big game, though, the biggest winners of Super Bowl weekend are the fans attending the wide variety of events hosted by NFL partners and other corporations across Phoenix.
Of course Americans will watch the game.  But who will we root for?  Who are we supposed to cheer for when it is Lex Luthor going against the Joker?  Maybe football needs a villain, but not two of them.
Half-baked in Boston...

The guy can still score, put butts in the seats at the Staples Center and has 32,482 career points. Maybe if the front office can put some pieces around him going into the final year of his contract, just maybe we will see Bryant go out on his own terms.
The Washington team's inappropriate response is unfortunately consistent with the \playbook\ that the Washington team and NFL continues to use to defend the offensive and harmful team name and logo of the Washington team.


Are you kidding me?
I was deeply troubled to discover that the NFL's approach to children is now the same as mega-corporations like Disney and McDonald's. The NFL not only wants children to \consume\ its products (licensed merchandise and televised football), it wants to immerse kids in its brand 24/7.
\When it's hard to talk, it's up to us to listen.\
If you\u2019re hoping for some closure on the \u201cdeflategate\u201d scandal by Super Bowl Sunday, tough luck.
The bottom line is that, unless you do something to change your perspective on expectations or to help you let go of those expectations, you have very little chance of doing your best and getting the results you want.
Freshman D'Angelo Russell had a pair of standout performances this week and proved that he's a legitimate one-and-done prospect.
They say that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. That certainly appears to be true with the NFL. Over the past year it has been rocked by a series of brand-damaging events that have been magnified by media coverage.
Why do some athletes and coaches cheat?  The quick answer
As anyone who has been alive in America over the past week knows, the New England Patriots have been accused of deflating the footballs they used in the first half of their crushing triumph over the Indianapolis Colts.
\u201cI\u2019m not too worried about coach Belichick competing with me,\u201d Nye said.



After a home defeat against Southampton, Manchester United were eager to return to the field in search of three points against relegation-fearing Queen Parks Rangers.

Football is not just a game of strategy, but it is counterstrategy, execution, recovery, calibration, recalibration and then again strategy and execution -- all in 24-second cycles. So what makes this possible? We pondered, why is football so different from other team sports like soccer, baseball or basketball.

An online ad released Friday hopes to show what a Washington game would be like without the Redskins mascot.
The commercial, which Friskies made with Buzzfeed, is intended to be \kitten-sized\ for the Super Bowl on Feb. 1.
We especially like the little skip at the end.


No?
The real question


Richard Sherman is good at football.



It was announced before the start of the game that both DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay will be out of the lineup.  But midway through the first quarter Gay checked in and added some spark to an already dominant offense.  The Kings got off to one of their best starts while maintaining a good pace with the Clippers.
I'm writing this to make a point that I feel can't ever become redundant.  I seem to keep having to argue a very necessary objective regarding the PSU/Paterno scandal and the NCAA sanctions.  I suppose I'll keep reiterating as often as possible until people who don't get it, do.
\I just don\u2019t like you.\
\This is Joe Paterno\u2019s legacy. This is Penn State\u2019s legacy. Football was more important to them than saving children.\

The 19th head coach of the 49ers has been the defensive line coach for the past eight seasons. He also served as the interim head coach for the final game in 2010 after Mike Singletary was fired.

St. Louis Ram owner Stan Kroenke's plan to build a state-of-the-art football stadium in Inglewood near Hollywood Park is the most promising opportunity for the return of the NFL to Los Angeles in many years.

Last night, the Kings took advantage of the LeBron-less Cavaliers to rout them 103-84.  Sacramento was at their best, getting off to an explosive start and never looked back.  Their last two wins have been decided by 19 or more points.

He transitioned with amazing grace from the hip young anchor to the established presence to the revered institution in front of us all.  It's just so sad that we couldn't see him make that final transition to elder statesman.



In 1975, the organizers of the traditional chess tournament in the Dutch coastal town of Wijk aan Zee inaugurated a prize for the most spectacular game. They expected breathtaking encounters, griping contests, and some glamour and charm.
A bull shark emptied Australia's Bondi Beach of people for nearly two hours on Friday, and had its 15 minutes of fame. But by Saturday, it had all but been forgotten in favor of a different breed of shark.






Black Monday in the NFL saw four more franchises fire their head coaches along with two general managers. Clearly there are situations where a head coach may have lost the ability to motivate his team or lost control of how to fix a losing situation and a change is needed. History shows however that stability at the coaching level is a key to success.

In his four years as head coach, Harbaugh led the 49ers to two NFC Championships and the Super Bowl. How is this not enough for a team that hadn't made it to the playoffs since 2002. Every players dream is to win a Super Bowl but the reality is, only a few teams who get the chance.
The question Iggles fans should be asking shouldn't be who won the power struggle? It should be why does a power struggle exist at all?



As years go, 2014 was an interesting one in the sports world. Some might characterize it as depressing while others may look back on it as exhilarating. Whatever the case may be we know that at some point in the future we will look back on the year 2014 with nostalgia.
For the players of Major League Baseball, the World Series is the ultimate goal. For directors of MLB games on television, it's a career-crowning achievement. For two decades, two directors have been a perennial postseason dynasty.
All sports, like life itself, involve risks. Unless we intend to keep our children by our sides, safe from the potential of injury, growing up entails dangers to life and limb.
Mackey is four-time champion of both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. He is the only musher to have won both races in the same year, with dual wins in both 2007 and 2008.
Dave Revsine, the Big Ten Network's lead studio host, stopped by The Interview Show to talk about his book on the beginnings of college football, The Opening Kickoff --\u00a0and how the game has changed and remained the same since then.
One thing we probably should do with such an elaborate gift is to break it down to what an apples to apples gift might look like if a similar \boss\ or leader wanted to show holiday generosity to his employees out of his or her pocket.




I am not asking for anything next Christmas. Instead, I want you to give it all away. With the exception of Carmelo, everyone can go. After all it is the season of giving, right?
The Book of Basketball by Bill Simmons should be considered the bible for basketball fans everywhere, and its crown jewel is The Pyramid, Simmons's idea for a new basketball Hall of Fame and his ranking of the 96 best players in basketball history.






hings just keep getting worse for the Forty-Niners.  After blowing a huge lead the San Diego Chargers fought back and tied the game to force an overtime and came away with the 38-35 victory over San Francisco.  Nick Novak's 40-yard field goal sealed their win in OT.




We projected a down week for Rodgers last week, but he bounces back into the top three this week against a bottom ten pass defense that will be without its best pass rusher this week.






After the game James was asked his reason for wearing the \I Can't Breathe\ T-shirt, and he responded, \It was a message to the family. That I'm sorry for their loss, sorry to his wife. That's what it's about.\ It appears that James was more interested in playing it safe, unwilling to ruffle the feathers of his corporate sponsors and brands.

However, while it's easy to lament to the failings of our sports fandoms in 2014, there's no denying that there was also a lot of good to come from the past year.
When Kobe Bryant talks, we listen. That's what five NBA titles and a league MVP gets you. As a result, it became national news when the 36-year-old Bryant was caught on camera going after his teammates for a lackluster effort during practice. \Soft,\ he called them.
The twin-engine Piper Navajo touched down -- and then the left landing gear folded, according to King Salmon airport manager Kyler Hylton, who stood watching with a fleet of fire trucks and ambulances as the aircraft approached.



Not a single \Romo hater\ has a legitimate reason for their position in my opinion. Sure, you haven't won a Super Bowl, but I highly doubt than any other quarterback would have won a ring on those teams.
United's road on this streak has been marked by their in-game success and return to form, but dotted with injuries to key players.
Recently, several St. Louis Rams players protested the Ferguson non-indictment, pantomiming \hands up, don't shoot\ as they came on the field. But in the '60s, the intersection of sports, politics and religion reached its zenith in the person of Muhammad Ali.
The much anticipated day of revelation has arrived. No, not the second coming of Bear Bryant, but rather the announcement from the Committee of Justice that on Sunday revealed the top four teams in college football.



On Wednesday night at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisconsin, Duke and UW met for perhaps the most anticipated basketball game of the year. Many people -- myself included -- picked Wisconsin to win.

In other words, we can look at what some very smart people are saying and see in their words more than a glimmer of hope for the Badgers if they win on Saturday.
In 2011, in an interview with The Golf Channel, I predicted a Tiger Woods comeback while many others said he was done. I was right that time and I am right again, and I'll say it right now and on the record

The best thing about \hot\ teams is that they eventually cool off.  But unfortunately for the Raptors that didn't happen.
In the contemporary, \nothing matters but this game\ NFL, spurred on by constant criticism in talk radio and social media, the slow development of a quarterback is not allowed. Win or be benched is the new mantra.

Enjoy the swan song of Bryant. He has moments of greatness that evoke the dominating superstar he has been. But, get used to a Lakers team that is allowing the most points per game in the NBA and has trouble scoring.
The dramatic circumstances of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases raise the issue of which aspects of an athlete's private life should be subject to public awareness and judgment.
A four-time NCAA Division-I All American at Oklahoma State University, Hendricks is an elite wrestler with tremendous knockout power in his left hand, who displayed improved boxing and low kicks during his last outing against Lawler.
For those who wonder why the owners have supported Goodell through the recent missteps and blunders it is only necessary to look at what the labor settlement and television contracts have done to team values. A lot of money has been delivered to the owners by Roger Goodell's achievements.
On November 26th, the nation's highest-profile pollster -- Nate Silver of the New York Times -- gave ten teams a better chance of making the inaugural College Football Playoff than the University of Wisconsin.

Nothing good for \number 27\ will come out of this proceeding. On the other hand, for those men and women who are victims of domestic violence, the public attention focused by the Rice proceeding might make more people aware of this societal scourge.

It's time to push the panic button. The 49ers will now have to win their remaining four games to get a chance to head back to the playoffs.

When an SUV slammed into musher Karin Hendrickson's four-wheeler Tuesday evening, she was thrown into the air and her dogs ran from the scene of the accident. She landed in a ditch about 20 feet away, then began making phone calls.

To highlight the Live ScoreCaster, we will take our in-game technology, Live ScoreCaster, to the next level to review the game-changing plays from the NFL and what the game would have looked like if the plays had turned out differently.
Washington tied the game again 10-10 with a 27-yard field goal from Forbath in the third.  Despite taking the lead in the fourth, the Redskins were no match for the 49ers in the end.  Washington lost their third game in a row and forth straight to San Francisco.



For the first time this season, a late attempt to score was successful with less than two minutes remaining on the clock.









Here are the up-to-date top three at each fantasy position for the week, a sleeper likely to have a breakout game (generally chosen as the best $/FP value on daily fantasy sites), a player to avoid (the worst $/FP value) and some injury situations to monitor heading into the week.
The college community has been told, over and over again, that Davidson College will have raised its national profile. But that profile in national surveys is a rather high one, for the right reasons, when recruiting students.







Once again, baseball writers are about to discriminate against a talented player for merely being the best at his position.  If the sport was more about being a meritocracy, we would have a few more votes for Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Craig Kimbrel for the Cy Young Award.
The incessant airing of Viagra's nauseating British-blonde-on-a-bed commercial during both this October's football games and throughout the baseball playoffs illustrates how tone-deaf the National Football League and Major League Baseball remain when it comes to truly embracing family viewers.













If someone told you before the season that the Sacramento Kings were going to shock people with an outstanding record this season, what would you have said? Probably something like, \You're nuts.\






Today I am a Bay Area resident with over 20 years under my belt. I support the local teams. They are two of the most exciting teams in baseball, but they are simply not mine. My heart is still with the Mets. And as hard as I have tried, I just can't quit them. I love them -- they are my team.
Tensions were high ahead of the clash of Manchester United and Chelsea. United manager Louis Van Gaal's hand was forced by injury and suspension to again adopt the 4-1-4-1 used against West Bromwich Albion.
The TCU Horned Frogs are currently 6-1 and 3-1 in the Big 12 conference. Their only loss of the season came against the Baylor Bears, who at that time was ranked fifth in the AP Poll and they only loss by three points 61-58.

Marcus Mariota, quarterback of Oregon, currently ranked fourth in our College Football Power Rankings, is looking to win his first career game over Stanford this Saturday.




For the second week in a row Detroit has rallied for a win. The Lions trailed 21-0 at the half and were just six percent likely to win after the first two quarters.
As we recognize that American sports and culture are not a \post-racial society\ after all, it's important to look back at the '60s, the era where there was perhaps the greatest change in the relationship between African-Americans and White America.

They have been here before, the Giants are one win away from winning their third World Series in five years.  But the road back to Kansas City won't be easy.
A scathing discovery just revealed that football and basketball athletes attending the much-revered University of North Carolina had received passing grades for courses they never took, primarily because the classes didn't exist.

Post-secondary education is absolutely critical in today's job market, except if you are among the few elite athletes who can succeed, at least in the short run, without a bachelor's degree.

The Giants leadoff batter Blanco was issued a free pass to start the first.  A wild pitch advanced him to second and he stole third.  Royals pitcher Jason Vargas walked Buster Posey putting two on in the corners.

If the Giants were hoping to win the World Series at home, the Royals had a different plan.  In the best of seven series, Kansas City took a 2-1 lead after edging San Francisco 3-2 for the win tonight.  It was a hard fought game from both teams but the Royals came out on top giving both an offensive and defensive effort from the start.


Over the past few weeks, college sport has once again taken over the lead in ink and air time; not actually games, of course, but stories that illustrate the corruption of higher education in America by the presence of intercollegiate athletics on campus, or more precisely football on campus.

Running used to appear on my to-do list somewhere after \read the dictionary\ and before \get a lobotomy.\ Now I'm training for my first marathon -- the 2014 TCS New York City Marathon. Previously, my longest run of all time was somewhere around 3 miles.

Selig's legacy may be that he lost the next generation of baseball fans. This is Selig's last World Series. Perhaps nothing demonstrates how baseball has turned off young sports fans than how young sports fans have turned off the World Series.
The PGA Tour wives have a unique lifestyle that few experience. Particularly when it comes to raising kids, there are uncommon demands placed on the families.
An ominous cloud hung over Chicago's fall chill all week. There was an uneasiness in the pit of Bears fans' stomachs they couldn't shake. Was the offensive explosion last week against the Atlanta Falcons an outlier? After Sunday's horrible 27-14 loss to the Miami Dolphins, the answer is a resounding yes.
The Kansas City Royals are in the World Series for the first since in nearly three decades, but it still won't save one of the greatest events in sports. This is the harsh reality for Major League Baseball, who routinely used to draw 50-million plus to crown its champion -- like it did in 1985 when the Royals last made it this far -- but will very likely sink below the 20 million mark, where it has stood for a decade.






The meltdown at Michigan following back-to-back home losses and the severe mishandling of concussed quarterback Shane Morris left the realm of my \passion\ and entered the world of \profession.\  I may have a love for football, but my career is in communications.

This is a field for the best and brightest, requires superb work ethic and commitment. The emotional and business rewards are well worth making this leap!





When a school team's hazing customs go unchecked, the bullying will grow more degrading every season. In many instances, each class looks to top its predecessor. Given how widespread hazing is, it cannot be eliminated.


Some folks say baseball has nothing to do with race relations in St Louis, but as a native St. Louisan, I beg to differ.


So far, based on the disclosure on its website, the bottom line appears to be that the NFL has raised about $7 million over 5 years in its breast cancer initiative.   Given the billions in revenues the league and its teams have made in that same period of time, this amount seems paltry.



Some stories deserve to be retold; with it breeds new life, purpose and most importantly understanding. It makes the process that much more magical -- an indelible piece of our history, if not in the physical, the mental and emotional.
In an era when cities are giving huge amounts of money to already wealthy owners (Cobb County is spending $368 million on a new stadium for the Braves), it's extremely refreshing to see a city like L.A. realize they are the ones with leverage.
The playoffs opened September 30 with the Wild Card Game in the American League where the Kansas City Royals showed up as the surprise guest and host. Over and over again came the reminders that the Royals had not been in post-season play since 1985 when they won the World Series.


First, he's coming into a much better situation in terms of what team he was drafted to, compared to Morrison joining the expansion Bobcats and becoming the most leaned-on player right away with the highest expectations.
If Major League Baseball wants to keep winning fans back, and promote good sportsmanship, they'll do the little things like this.










According to an unpublished study by two University of Vanderbilt researchers, college coaches are worth the money because of the revenue these coaches bring to the university. The study reaches this conclusion by comparing the salaries paid to college football coaches to the salaries paid to CEOs of public companies.







I've been watching baseball pretty avidly since I was 8 (more than 35 years now, horrifying as that is to type).  And while Ichiro may not have been the best player I've ever seen (he rarely walked or hit with power), I think he's been my favorite player to watch.





I was 6 years old when I went to my first Major League game on October 2, 1964. The Philadelphia Phillies beat the Cincinnati Reds, 4-3, at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Amidst the unrelenting furor surrounding the NFL and domestic violence the past three weeks, a critically important story concerning football, and all collision sports slipped by virtually unnoticed.

If you're a Boston Red Sox or New York Mets fan (or another who's been on the receiving end of one of his clutch hits or into-the-stands or leaping-catch play), you've probably been waiting for this day for quite some time
The myth has been repeated by nearly everyone that the owners won't fire Goodell because he has done an outstanding job and brought all NFL teams a tremendous increase in financial value. The truth is quite different, and the only thing overvalued is Goodell himself.


Well, I did it.  A whole weekend -- plus Monday night -- without football.  No Sunday NFL, no Saturday college (non-pro) football, no Monday night football.  None. Zero. Nada.   And here I am to tell the tale.



A few months ago I wrote a post critical of former NFL coach Tony Dungy's campaign to eliminate marriage equality and to prevent gay couples from adopting children.


Seattle blew a 17-3 fourth quarter lead and were 99.9 percent likely to win after Steven Hauschka kicked a 28-yard field goal to give the Hawks a 20-12 lead with 1:04 left to play.

Taken at face value, a rare acknowledgment by International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach that sports and politics are inextricably intertwined should be a first step towards radical reform that offers a proper structure to govern the relationship.



Roger Goodell continued to play the role of Pete Rozelle, as envisioned by Roger Goodell. The arrogance was there, but the credibility was missing. The assertions of rectitude were repeated ad nauseam and they fell on deaf ears.





The NFL is a huge business, but with its success comes great responsibility.  Yet the owners and commissioner of the NFL have been more committed to protecting their business than in getting out ahead on several key social issues that have faced the league.  Where is the leadership?


The NFL has not even begun to systematically examine holistically whether the on-field behaviors they champion translate into off-field recklessness. If NFL leadership fails to make that connection and render changes to the sport's culture of violence, then the banner of flag football may get the call to save the league even sooner than I once predicted.

It is arrogance rooted in a linear focus for success that can render one blind to other variables.  Hardly a new phenomenon, arrogance can infiltrate all aspects of the human condition, regardless of size or mission.
What started as a sprained ankle back in April for Texas Ranger Shin-Soo Choo, has now progressed into surgery to repair/remove \torn ankle cartilage.\
Baseball is America's homegrown version of Zen Buddhism. Good day? Fine, but don't get cocky. Lousy day? Fine, too, but do better tomorrow. You win some, you lose some; some get rained out. All fine.
Barreling headlong into the 20th Century, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club in St. Andrews, Scotland, votes September 18 on whether to admit women. It's the same day Scots go to the polls to vote on whether to secede from Britain.
Ray Rice did damage. His actions were completely unacceptable. But like Ray Rice, I've done damage. My behavior, a few times in my life, has been completely unacceptable. And the same goes for you and the many people who've jumped on the bandwagon of judgment.
Athletes are a special case in our society, because their gifts are recognized so young, and they are rewarded for those gifts so young that they can easily get wrapped in a cloak of entitlement.
It was a rough night if your name is Tim.  The Dodgers returned the favor after begin shutout last night.  Tim Hudson gave up four runs in the first while both he and Tim Lincecum allowed four more hits in the second.








It's time for all of us all to act, and to demand much more from those in positions of leadership in the NFL.  I also hope that President Obama and Members of Congress voice their views, not to score political blood-score points, but as human beings who are fathers and mothers, who want America to be a place where their daughters don't live in fear.
Violence, on and off the field...







The Sinquefield Cup in Saint Louis was promised to be extraordinary this year
Until Peyton Manning hangs them up, he and Andrew Luck will play against each other at least once a season. That once is Sunday night.

It seems that we can only count on the National Football League and it's teams to do the right thing when there are no more lies to hide behind. The money they make and the appearances that they try so hard to keep up are their main focus.
The Seattle Seahawks kicked off the 2014 season against the Green Bay Packers. I shot the game with the Lytro light-field camera. Lytro pictures are interactive photos built for the web. The camera incorporates a new technology known as light-field photography.

Twenty-one years after the the Ultimate Fighting Championship broadcast its first open-weight competition in 1993, the world's largest MMA promotion is returning to its roots with a single-elimination tournament to crown its initial women's 115-pound title holder.
The NFL season is finally here. Are you ready? I know I am. I'll confess to all of you nice people on the internet (just between us), that I have a bit of a football addiction. Some might even call it a gambling addiction.
With the NHL Season Opener just over a month away, hockey fans everywhere are gearing up and placing their expectations.


Roger Goodell is the commissioner of the most popular professional sports league in the United States. This week he demonstrated just how much he learned at the feet of his predecessors, Paul Tagliabue and especially Pete Rozelle.

The NFL returns with a full schedule of games that actually count in the standings. While those with favorite clubs still in contention for baseball's post-season linger on in their affection for the leisurely game of summer, most of us are ready to turn the page. Are you ready for some football?




The NFL should recognize that the degrees of separation between overt bigotry and unconscious biases may be few, and the effects equally harmful. If a team failed to draft Sam based on his sexual orientation, the team discriminated against him and should consider the rightness of its actions.




From my perspective as an agent, I really do not see a downside to an athlete embracing this cause. I would gladly work for an openly gay player or a player who speaks up in support of the LGBT community.




Following the trend of \Moneypuck\ - how can the Leafs spend more money, to see the highest ROI?  The cap is the cap - you can't change that.  So where else can they invest in?













MLB has an obligation to see that the right call is made and made quickly. New use of technology and the introduction of some new common-sense rules will result in faster play, fairer calls, happier fans and bigger gates.
These critiques of athletes are not new. They have been articulated for years, in barbershops, bars, social media, various articles and blogs, by the everyday fan to the most celebrated scholars. But many still are misguided and inaccurate.



With the U.S. Open set to begin Monday, it opens yet another chapter in one of the most compelling storylines of the tennis summer. That is, of course, the resurgence of Roger Federer to place himself once again among the top contenders in the sport.
Until the time comes when the NFL, or the sponsors, or others in positions of power convince or coerce Mr. Snyder into changing the team's nickname, we are left with the moral power of shunning.


It's been awhile since these two teams have faced each other.  Now it's a battle for first place and while the A's have held the position for half the season, the Angels now own it but in this much anticipated series will determine the better of the two teams.












We're approaching the end of August, and, like every year, that means the MLB season is starting to get interesting. Teams are jostling in the standings for playoff positions, and both the drama, and calibre of baseball is starting to increase.
Whenever we can, we take people to task for being vile. We. We, the consuming public.  We have a voice.






The young Chinese team won the 41st Chess Olympiad in Troms\u00f8, Norway. They became the only undefeated team among 176 participating countries, winning eight matches and tying three, scoring 19 points.





Skateboarding isn't a new phenomena but thanks in large part to SLS, it's becoming much more lucrative. There are four events on the 2014 SLS tour, and each one pays at least $100,000 in 1st place prize money, with the total series purse exceeding $1 million.
Much to the disappointment of his grand plan - Alfie didn't win a cup by signing with the Red Wings in July 2013 for one year.  He did record a respectable season, with 18 goals, and 49 points in only 68 games.



Outside of Nadal, every member of the Big 4 rolled into Toronto for the Rogers Cup at the start of this week, and every single one fell to Tsonga.
College Sports
The world of college athletics was changed this week by the decision of a federal district court judge in California who ruled that the NCAA violates the nation's antitrust laws when it prohibits college athletes from marketing their names and likenesses.

The A's have finally figured out how to win games.  Collectively the offense has improved as well as the defense.




How does the Cavs' ascension affect the rest of the league?

The old saying, \Let 'em eat cake,\ was a better reward for the great Bushwacker who scored an astounding win last night against his rival J.B Mauney.
Indiana's Paul George had yet to be wheeled into the operating room, and the naysayers and sports pundits were speculating as to the response of the Pacers' Larry Bird and his fellow NBA front office cohorts.

Athletes have a unique role to play in triggering attitudinal change regarding violence against women. When they are instigators of this behavior, it sends a message that it is somehow acceptable because our heroes are involved.












Well, whatever we thought was plaguing front offices to make them so boring is apparently gone, because we got a whole lot of big time trades yesterday.




Like Lebron James, the NBA appears dedicated to setting a proper example. Like Johnny Football, the NFL has continually skirted responsibility for its actions and realities.







Ryan Vogelsong got off to a great start.  He retired the first nine batters he faced but unraveled in the fourth.  Again he got no run support as the Giants got shutout 5-0 by the Dodgers.








While only two competitors can be named \The Fittest on Earth,\ elite CrossFit coach Carl Paoli wants you to know that everyone -- yes, even you -- can move and feel like a champion CrossFitter.
You hear a number of sports pundits clamoring about throwing out the records of those who have used performance enhancing drugs. But really, everyone knows how impractical that would be.

The Confederation of Brazilian Football (CBF) today confirmed its selection of Carlos Dunga as coach of the Brazilian national team. Dunga succeeds Luiz Felipe Scolari, who resigned after Brazil's disappointing performance at the World Cup.



In American horse racing, the middle of July heralds the opening of the Saratoga Race Meet in Saratoga Springs, upstate New York.
Big wave surfing is no joke, those who do it risk their lives on waves that are over 60 feet high and weigh as much as 400 tons.
ith the market starting to take shape for college football tickets, TiqIQ released the Top 25 most expensive average prices for the 2014 season. Eight schools from the SEC are in the Top 25, the most of any conference.
Shortly after the final was over on July 7, 1974, I took the train from Amsterdam to the German town of Solingen where I was scheduled to play an important international chess tournament.


On Sunday, Rachel Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals. As Jackie's partner, and as the person who has kept alive Jackie's legacy, Rachel has had a significance influence in her own right.



Don't look now, but baseball's hottest team is the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, who entered the All-Star break with a 57-37 record, 1 1/2 games behind the first place Oakland Athletics in the American League West.








This is, of course, a false contrast as baseball is popular in much East Asia, the Caribbean and increasingly in a few other countries besides the US. Soccer, while the world's most popular sport has failed to catch on in many parts of South Asia and is one of several popular sports in Australia, parts of East Asia and North America.




Germany earned its 4th World Cup title but first in 24 years -- titles just don't come easy. In the process, Germany saved more salt being rubbed into Brazil's still fresh wounds.
His time in Los Angeles will influence Asian Americans, particularly male youth, in countless ways (not to mention those jersey sales.) All eyes will be on the California native, to see what he'll do for Los Angeles.
My connection with Sam Schmidt is personal. Twelve years ago he allowed me to live out a boyhood dream of averaging a 200-mph lap in an Indy car, a risky proposition even for pro drivers. I was just an adventure journalist.
The decision of LeBron James to return to Cleveland to finish his NBA career and his eloquent rationale will elevate him to the pantheon of American heroes. This strikes a dramatic blow to the \money is everything\ mentality that has permeated sports.
I like LeBron's choice this time for many of the same reasons you might like it, but I have another very good reason for liking it. James, perhaps unwittingly, has gotten out of the engineering business.


The nation has largely decided to paint Carmelo Anthony, an easy target already, as a villain because we've been unable to paint LeBron James as one.







It's the kid from Akron's turn to help his hometown out. This will be fun to watch for the next few years as we again watch LeBron transition into another point in his life.
There was shock and surprise as Twitter blew up around 12:30 p.m. EDT on Friday as LeBron James announced his much-awaited decision via Sports Illustrated \I'm Coming Home.\  I was not surprised at all. I totally understood. Where you grew up is part of your soul.
This is and isn't about LeBron James returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers. This is about a man growing up and breaking free. To understand the magnitude of LeBron's decision, we need to examine the Decision.
The big problem is that Lebron made choices in 2010 that ignited the anger on both sides. Those who worshipped him felt betrayed. Those who were jealous of him were proved to be right. Everyone got to hate him. And that felt good for a while.


I am not a fan of The Beautiful Game, although I do watch and appreciate its beauty especially when it is displayed by the likes of Lionel Messi. Soccer, as with all games, when played with skill and competence is a beautiful game.
Love him or hate him, LeBron James's announcement transcends the world of sports.  And, when looking at his life and career, it is hard not to think of him as the NBA's version of Batman.

While in my heart I empathized with the feelings of the people from Brazil, a country I love and whose soccer I admire, I also felt joy in seeing the fruits of the Klinsmann/Low revolution in German soccer. The soccer they play today is a complete departure from the soccer German teams played prior to 2010 or 2006.




After the way they've acted in recent years, LeBron James might want to take a pass on coming back to Cleveland. However, it seems that LeBron has shown more maturity than the people who cursed his name four years ago.
A whole industry has developed which has nonstop reporting of arrests, domestic problems, money issues, and alcohol and drug abuse by these stars. This requires the athlete to be extra scrupulous in where and how he is seen in public. Venues like Las Vegas can be especially challenging.
The ever-present danger is what makes BASE jumpers the most extreme athletes in the world. Many people call them daredevils; most people call them crazy. They know there's a good chance they'll die, but that's what makes them feel alive.


Clearly, the weight of national expectation had been too great for Brazil's players to bear without the presence on the field of their two leaders to inspire them and hold them together.








I should not have been thinking about hockey at my dear friend's father's funeral. However, on May 4, 2014, at age 44, I publicly declared myself a New York Rangers fan, and today, I still can't remember what else I used to think about.



With the season only half over, the Giants still could end up with a playoff spot, but if they continue their losing ways for another week or two, even that will be unlikely.

For those of you who feel compelled to air your rather dated and utterly predictable anti-soccer sentiments during this World Cup, may I take a moment to remind you of a few salient points...
Allez les bleus! Ooops, no sorry, that's for football (what some call soccer, whatever). Saturday, July 5 saw the departure of the three-week long Tour de France starting in... Leeds, Yorkshire in the north east of England, don't ask.


Let's step back and do a reality check for a moment, shall we? We like to think we are good at that here in America. So, here's the mea culpa about the U.S. performance at the FIFA 2014 World Cup.





t's hard to think that Russia, or Qatar, or frankly anywhere could match that atmosphere.




Most level-headed folks know that Ann Coulter is constantly baiting her readership, and it is very possible that her remarks about soccer were meant as satirical commentary. But it did cause me to wonder why more Americans seem drawn to soccer these days.
To many of my friends in the U.S., sports often entail beer on a Sunday night. To some in Africa, it might mean making and playing with a football made from plastic bags. But this is exactly how sports unite by highlighting commonality among those who are otherwise very different.
Because there's more to these attractive men than their good looks. But... also their good looks.



The last time the United States played Belgium was in a friendly match last year when Belgium beat the U.S. 4-2. Since then, Team USA has come a long way.












Coulter buttresses her warning that the growing interest in soccer is a sign of our nation's moral decay with the facts that soccer \is foreign... the French like it,\ it is \like the metric system\ and, worst of all, \You can't use your hands in soccer.\






The World Cup group stage passes again with it usual splendor, perennial giants seemingly collapsed, new chosen ones in their place, the stereotypical upsets, referee gaffes, miscellaneous action, and repeated history.

Pricing by Qatari entities holding World Cup rights for the Middle East and North Africa, including Al Jazeera's belN Sports channel, puts broadcasts beyond the reach of many football fans in the region.
The reactions this has solicited may seem absurd to anyone outside Uruguay, and several people have asked me




















The Iranian team's performance so far with its 0:0 draw against Nigeria in its first World Cup match in which it was not defeated in its first tournament game as well as the encounter with Argentina, has spared Mr. Rouhani and his government being blamed for another failure.

















This great World Cup 2014 of shocks and beautiful, counterattacking football continued on, in its three Friday games, with even more treats being offered up this weekend -- Germany vs Ghana on June 21, Belgium vs Russia, and Dempsey's USA vs Ronaldo's Portugal on June 22.
Will the excitement over the first round victory by the U.S. and its continued success be a game-changer for the future of the MLS?







NHL commissioner Gary Bettman is a controversial figure in many circles. That includes not only among fans and segments of the media, but also among some on the playing and officiating sides of the game.


You can win a championship but still not be a great team.  You can have many great players and not win a championship. That's because the whole is less than the sum of its parts.






























How can you expect us to get on board with the USMNT when the coach doesn't even believe in them? If I had a chance to counsel Klinsmann on public relations for his team, I could limit it to three words



The world is watching to see if Brazil can win the World Cup on their home turf. There are many reasons to watch this sporting event but here are a few.


Even with his on-court play diminished due to age, OKC signed Fisher for the exact same reason KD admired him


The news that the Pac-12 Conference jumped to the head of the class in 2012-13, earning $330 million in record revenue comes as no surprise. Welcome to the new college sports business model.
Over the years as my naivet\u00e9 diminished, I gradually became aware of the realities of the sport and the way its heroes are abused and mistreated for our pleasure.


A few hours before Miguel Cotto challenged Sergio Martinez for the middleweight championship, Ray \Boom Boom\ Mancini told me, \Everyone thinks the way to beat a southpaw is with the straight right down the middle, but it's really the left hook.\



It was a pitcher's duel through the first four frames. Matt Cain returned to the mound after his second stint on the disable list this season. Cain was probably the best he's been all season, he retired the first twelve batters he faced and held the New York Mets scoreless through five innings.



It is, of course, not fair to blame the Dodgers' and Reds' shortcomings entirely on their leadoff hitters, but it is also unfair to overlook the player who has been the leadoff hitter on the team with the best record in the National League thus far.


Just a few days away from the largest sporting festival in the world, the stories coming out of Brazil are not so festive. The handwringing reflects less on Brazil, but on whether the world even needs a World Cup anymore.

He was once compared to Brazilian striker Adriano, and fans will be hoping that his similar traits -- great strength and a rocket of a shot -- can blast Ecuador out of one of the easier groups in the tournament. They face France, Switzerland, and Honduras.












This happens to be the most stacked and more importantly deep draft in a decade, so there's a good chance some of these players can make a difference.

The moribund Cavs have once again been given basketball's gift of gifts, winning the lottery for the third time in four years. And while they can choose between the supremely talented Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker and Julius Randle, Joel Embiid is their best choice.
The center of professional chess in America is Saint Louis, Missouri. For the last six years the U.S. championship was held at the local Chess Club and Scholastic Center. With Nakamura absent this year, all eyes were on Gata Kamsky, the defending champion and the oldest participant. Could he still defend the title at the age of 39?

None of these victories made me as proud of my club as finding out about how my club defied anti-Semitism and the Nazis.

San Francisco won the 2-1 decision over the Twins and improved to 5-0 in Interleague play this season.  They clinched the three-game series and won six of their last seven games against Minnesota.  The Giants now own the best record in the Majors.



Fresh from tentatively settling the class action lawsuit based on the concussions suffered by its players, the National Football League faces a new challenge that promises to cause the League migraines for years to come.

National Golf Day was May 21, 2014. There are so many great things about golf that extend far beyond the actual sport.
Many thought the Warriors would've gone with a more veteran coach who can lead the team past the second round of the playoffs. But instead the owners and senior management wanted something different and less problematic.



All that was good has come crashing down now that manager David Moyes has got the sack before he even made it through a single season.






A few months ago, Kellen Moore's career took one step forward. By the start of minicamp, it took two steps back when Lions GM Martin Mayhew verbally slapped it away.
In the NBA, a team needs at least two reliable shot-creators to win in the postseason -- players capable of manufacturing an open look for themselves or for a teammate at will. For LA, Chris Paul and Blake Griffin are those primary playmakers.

The mighty fell hard. Despite once being considered Mariano Rivera's eventual replacement or at least a top-of-the-rotation mainstay, the Yankees decided against re-signing Chamberlain this offseason.

I was first introduced to Club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid while speeding along the winding, uneven and narrow streets of Madrid's La Latina district, perched precariously upon the back of a small motorcycle belonging to a maniacal Spaniard.



There was no doubt that Manziel was going to be drafted by the Browns.  When Roger Goodell announced his name, the crowd erupted.  The Browns had officially stolen the first round, making headlines all across America.
In today's NFL full of pass-happy offenses and hybrid defensive fronts, football reasons alone can't justify why an award-winning pass-rusher like Sam fell so far in the draft.
Mark May 8 on your calendar



World soccer body FIFA has dispatched investigators to Egypt to probe allegations of government interference as the country prepares for potentially risky bids to host two international tournaments, the 2017 Beach Soccer World Cup and the 2018 FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup.












Watching this year's Kentucky Derby winner, California Chrome, made me reflect on my own peak experience as an owner in a racehorse who also wasn't expected to become anything special amongst the 30,000+ racehorses that are born each year.

That's precisely why racism holds on within America. In the privacy of our homes, clubs, and offices -- and in the tradeoff of philanthropy and what we perceive as the greater good -- we ignore our values, dismiss and rationalize them.






Being that golf is one of the most expensive sports to play, pricey items like golf clubs, attire, and greens fees often make the game cost-prohibitive for today's youth. Not surprisingly the National Golf Foundation has reported a precipitous decline in participation, threatening the game's future.

The first Supercross race to take place anywhere in the Northeast in 23 years is now in the record books.


An NBA team is a business, but it also carries the imagery of representing that city.  Sports and athletes can provide opportunities for positive role modeling and influencing attitudes -- when turned negative, the effects ripple.





As I prepared to write about an act of uncommon decency by a professional athlete, I realized that calling it that was unfair, that it diminishes what happened, because this was simply an act of uncommon decency, period.












It's not every day one gets to meet an owner of a National Football League team, particularly if you have a mustache -- unless you hang around St. Louis or Jacksonville.

As baseball season starts up again, I am forcefully reminded that marrying a Boston Sports Fan can sometimes be a challenge.
