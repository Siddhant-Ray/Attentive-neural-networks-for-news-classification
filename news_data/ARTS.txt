The 70-minute piece opens with the nine-member ensemble confined to a small square patch of stage illuminated by Lucy Carter.

It has taken the Met Opera 100 years to get Bizet's Les Pecheurs de Perles back on the stage, but the new production the company unveiled in a gala New Year's Eve premiere is such a spectacular success, beautifully sung and acted by a splendid cast and chorus, it should secure the opera a place in the repertory for years to come.
Children can be remarkably resilient. But what about adults who struggle to cope with the demands of their personal and professional lives? Will they happily go with the flow of new-found freedoms and technology? Or will they dig in their heels and resist change with the angry determination of a frightened adolescent?
Sally Mann opens her memoir, Hold Still (Little, Brown), by invoking the muese. An outdated word, the meuse is a mark left in the ground after a small animal leaves; the grass or dust bears an imprint of its departed body.

Among the painters I know, skill is a hot topic. Everyone seems to intuitively know what it is -- they know it when they see it -- and the implications of having or not having skill are generating lively, fresh conversations and opinionated writing.
The San Francisco Opera recently scored a major success with its new production of Donizetti's 1835 opera, Lucia di Lammermoor, which had been updated to some kind of modern mythic landscape.


There is no one type of museum artist-in-residence program. In many institutions, the artist-in-residence program is run out of the museum's education department with a very specific mandate to develop and complete projects with school-age children, and there may be no studio or materials for the artists or opportunities for them to exhibit their own work.

Spring Awakening left Broadway just six years ago. And its original cast -- Jonathan Groff, John Gallagher Jr. and Lea Michele -- left huge shoes to fill. But it's a delight to see the story has lost none of its impact, the score and songs none of their dusky, moody impact.

Shylock's inflexible insistence on the bond he made with Antonio for a pound of flesh were the 3,000 ducats not repaid -- that's to say, Shylock's unrelenting stance as a broader revenge on the Christians who've tormented him throughout life as a usurer -- is decidedly matched by his tormenters' virulent prejudice.
Liking and appreciating works of art involves a give and take, and the idea of a idea of a private conversation in which a work of art responds by deepening its meanings and offering more profound pleasures is apt and beautiful. It is precisely this kind of conversation that wakes up our taste for art, which involves a kind of deep affinity or even passion.
It was difficult to explain to this passionate Cuban man that I didn't want to marry anybody. Still don't. Why not? I'm one of those men that Professor Henry Higgins described as \a confirmed old bachelor, and likely to remain so.\

While playwrights such as Lynn Nottage (51), Suzan Lori-Parks (52), George C. Wolfe (60), and Ntozake Shange (66) are familiar names on the theatrical landscape, a younger generation of gifted African-American dramatists such as Katori Hall (34) and Marcus Gardley (37) have been impressing audiences with their work.
In the late 1960s a new brand of cigarettes was introduced by Philip Morris International. A spinoff of the popular Benson & Hedges brand, its marketing was aimed at female smokers enjoying a new sense of liberation. For better or worse, the advertising slogan for Virginia Slims insisted that \You've Come A Long Way, Baby.\

Most of us, upon hearing the term amuse-bouche, instantly think of food. But in some situations I often think of programs which offer a collection of short plays as a long string of amuse-bouches. Some are tastier and have more heft than others; some have an almost ethereal appeal.
The great hall of the world's most influential international art fair might seem like the last place one might find utopia. Indeed, it almost seems antithetical to the art fair environment, as a realm of commercial activity predicated on exclusivity and lavish displays of luxury it is hardly the setting for utopian ideals.

Sir Alfred DiMora showed a special enthusiasm for cars at ten years old when he began to race miniature slot cars, which led to a genuine passion for the automobile.

Sophie Calle is the kind of woman who you know that you would want to be friends with. Her obsession with personal objects, wry knowingness and ability to stalk someone at will make her the prime candidate for any discerning art lover. Through her work, it's practically impossible not to fall in love with her.

Bruce Norris, who has given us the award-winning Clybourne Park (about race relations) and the less-successful Domesticated (about the broken marriage of a philandering politician), turns to wife-swapping in The Qualms.
In 1961, at 17 years old, I moved into a floor thru pink brownstone on the corner of Bleeker and Jones Street in the West Village of New York City. It was heaven.

Perhaps it was inevitable that I would eventually end up interviewing family - as I am not the lone artist in our bloodline. So, as a photography and arts blogger, it made sense to corner my aunt, painter Susan Sweet, and try to squeeze a little more than an artist statement out of her. Here is my attempt.


I am currently sitting on a flight headed from Los Angeles to New Orleans. I am in a middle seat between my fianc\u00e9 and a dear friend. Both have had two Bloody Marys and are passed out because they don't like to fly. I, on the other hand, love to fly.

There was never a time when Jean's Ritchie's voice wasn't part of my life. Growing up as I did in a folk music community, she was a constant influence. Best of all was Jean's own singing -- gentle, unassuming and beautiful, with that clear, high voice.
Of all the important artists of the modern era, Frida Kahlo's work is perhaps the most inseparable from her biography and her unique physical appearance. Her life and art are presently interpreted in three exhibitions

They filed in, one by one, a long line of fourth- and fifth-grade students, quiet and well-behaved until they crossed the threshold of the Asia Society gallery. And then, one by one, they gasped, cried out, and-- in the case of one young boy-- jumped and nearly fell on landing.

The art world is a swiftly flowing river. The currents shove every artist along, indiscriminately, at a fast clip. A few pass by twice while most flow through only once. Sometimes, an artist can get lodged along the riverbank, snagged onto a hold. Sometimes that \new land\ grows into a promontory.
Sergei Rachmaninoff 's Symphony no. 3, composed in the mid-30s, was also a commission by the Philadelphia Orchestra. It has a surface of the composer's signature romanticism, but he blasts through that shape shifting to something more aggressive.

Creating what his gallery term \fine art installations,\ and roaming across a wide range of media, techniques and subjects, Aitken's work has been difficult to categorize. But taken together, these three shows should give the unacquainted viewer a full overview of who he is.

\Picasso's Recession-Proof Harem\ was the first of a total of 259 blogs that I have posted over a five-year span. That means I have averaged just under a blog a week over time. When I started, I had absolutely no idea that I was capable of writing so much or so often. Blogging has been a huge surprise for me
Two productions new to San Francisco had that special aura about them
In 2011, Vu made his first laser-engraved wooden surfboard, setting out to make 210, one for each of the Beatles' songs.

Like Hand to God, Permission is outrageous and profane; like its predecessor, it can be seen as a sledgehammer attack on religion featuring violence and sex, albeit without as much bloodshed. But there the similarities end. Hand to God is inspired; Permission, alas, is not.

The Venice Biennale is built on paradox and contradiction

Janet's tale, about a young married British couple in Northern England in 1961, is a strangely compelling look at the state of consumerism and love gone goofy. Equal parts social commentary and theater of the absurd, One Hand Clapping, at 59E59 Theaters, is a thoughtful and engaging dark comedy.
If it's offbeat revues you're after, make a beeline to the short-run Street Singer
Billie Holiday was born in Philadelphia in 1915, grew up in Baltimore, moved to New York, started to sing while still in her teens and soon changed music history as the inimitable Lady Day.

Is loving sex all that it's cracked up to be? Or is it the province of bad movies like Love Story (1970) or another sixties classic A Man and a Woman (1966). One of the nice things about a film like Richard Linklater's Before Midnight (2013) is that it shies away from loving sex.
I sat in during rehearsal with Sheila and the youth. After the initial sound check, Sheila sat down on the edge of the stage and said

The New York art scene isn't only about New York anymore
Directed by Jang Hee-Sun, My Fair Wedding is a curious, but ultimately triumphant documentary that was screened at CAAMFest 2015.

When a company's principal dancers and soloists are this excellent, your choice of casts often comes down to those whose acting ability or personal style/charisma grabs you.

What a month in the art world

Red solo cups are not the stuff of sonnets. There is no poetry in sweaty basements. The millennial party experience has remained a fairly untouched source material for fine art, suggesting tailgates have no place in the theatre.
Whenever I feel a darkness creep into my soul, I sing, dance and play music on the adungu, a traditional hand-held harp of northern Uganda. It always works, the darkness recedes. Art is my detox.

My advice to artists is  \INSTAGRAM it.\  I started with Instagram after Oliver Luckett, who recommended it, said to me \just feed it.\ Just like the White Rabbit of Jefferson Airplane, \Feed your head.\ The rabbit hole of Instagram is a cool way to get support for an artist.

Jonathan Miller's 1997 production of The Rake's Progress, revived at the Metropolitan Opera House for the first time since 2003, and around for only two additional performances, eschews the look.
German composer Kurt Weill was no stranger to Nazi harassment. A prominent and popular Jewish composer, he fled to Paris in 1933. Well known for his theater hits, such as The Threepenny Opera and Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, he soon headed to the safety of New York.
Helgi Tomasson's Romeo and Juliet made a comeback at San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House last night, buoyed by a vivid and sensitive performance of the Prokofiev score by the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra, under the electrifying baton of Martin West.
The legendary rock impresario Bill Graham was not a particularly observant Jew. There is nothing specifically Jewish about the bands he worked with, such as the Grateful Dead or the Rolling Stones, or the venues in which he produced concerts, such as at the Fillmore (East and West) and Winterland arenas.
The show starts with a display of coins and medals that refers to the way Victorians wanted to appropriate Imperial Roman imagery. Visually these medals are disappointing and confusing.
You can't run away from your own entity. Why not embrace it? Learning and truly loving yourself is one of the best decisions you can ever make. Trust me.

Tanya Hartman is a storyteller. Her work, in all its varying disciplines (painting, crafting, mixed media) covers a large swath of ground, ensuring all the details of her tales are taken into account.  So That I May Carry You With Me is an exquisitely detailed pastiche at the Daum Museum in Sedalia, Missouri.

The lack of diverse children's books published annually does not reflect the rich cultural tapestry that surrounds us.
As an idealist, I always like to assume that radical revolutions will inevitably cultivate a kind of \counter-culture\ in opposition to the establishment and prevailing norms.  Take, for example, the Mexican Revolution with its mural art, or even the Russian Revolution.

Small theater is one of the most welcoming places for fresh new voices. In this series I will begin to prove why.
This weekend, a few dozen New Yorkers attended an event at Tibet House

On a cool, damp spring morning in London, it is a great pleasure to walk into the National Gallery to bask in the sunny landscapes of Monet, Pissarro, and their friends.




McVicar's choice to treat the operas as two separate pieces is interesting. Yes, they're two different pieces by two different composers, but they share multiple common themes. Pagliacci's composition was, in fact, inspired by Cavalleria.

he sequence encapsulated everything Schwartz needed to say to make her dramatic point.  Were it to stand alone, lyricist Schwartz and composer-lyricist Almond would be in good stead.

As An American in Paris opens at the Palace Theater, a Nazi flag seemingly draped over an entire city, drops down and floats away. The city is Paris, its narrow streets dour until we get to a caf\u00e9, where an American soldier, Jerry meets an American composer.
Two recent stories (one on film, the other onstage) highlight the role an extended family can play in the lives of ordinary people. While the situations in these two stories are wildly different, they point to the need for connection and inclusion as well as a sense of spiritual, intellectual, and emotional intimacy.
Laura Borneman hails from Buffalo, New York, and has finally, after years of wandering, \returned home.\ By this I mean, she has returned to living in Buffalo, New York, after years of wandering around the United States; and her work quite tangibly is all about the idea of \home.\

There's a rip-roaring, malevolently Machiavellian, viciously nasty, blood-letting saga of intrigue and incest on view just now. No, not in the cloistered cloakrooms of the U.S. House of Representatives; no incest there, presumably.
Reviewers are not expected to be kind but to be fair.  Every once in a while, though, a reviewer feels the need to be kind.  Clinton The Musical (note no colon) has generated that feeling in me.

Two recent productions by small theatre companies in Berkeley focused on fictional American families with more than enough misery to go around.
The king must have a son. That's the simple, overriding fact that powers the action of the new drama Wolf Hall; that and the fact that King Henry VIII (Nathaniel Parker) has a wandering eye and once he's had a woman he loses interest.
David Allan Peters, has been building heavily layered paintings that he carves into to reveal rich stratigraphies of color. Kaleidoscopic in their intensity, Peters' works are both intuitive excavations and explorations of pattern.

An extraordinary improvising musician who styles himself a \noir pianist,\ Ran celebrates his 80th birthday on August 20 this year. He can look back, and indeed forward, at a life spent entirely in music as a performer and as an educator.


The String Quartet was initiated by Joseph Haydn. His pieces were written for, and performed by, the educated amateur, often an aristocrat and his friends and family. It was parlor music in the best sense of that phrase.

The plaintive cry of the mizmar undulates through the air. Ahead of the musicians, four men, impeccably dressed in high street fashion, lead the funeral procession with heads held high. But they don't walk in mournful solemnity. They strut.
I believe that Diego Rivera's and Frida Kahlo's frescoes, currently at the Detroit Institute of Arts and Jean Michel Basquiat; The Unknown Notebooks, currently at the Brooklyn Museum since last Friday, are examples of a curatorial trend in which the life of the artists is transformed into the source of artistic value of the art displayed.
To celebrate Rockwell Group's 30th anniversary, Crane.tv sat down with the founder and creative mind of the architecture firm, to talk about four projects that have shaped his career as much as the city.

It's in fact part of the narrative that Rome's Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza is at first off limits, much like the recondite knowledge of heaven, earth and esthetics that's the film seeks to explore.

The idea behind this exhibition is one of hope, one that combines classical painting techniques of the past and brings them with us into the 21st Century, into what we call a post contemporary paradigm.
While some of the images may have local bluestocking blue-hairs clutching their pearls before the scales fall from their eyes, the less provincial and parochial will be able to appreciate what Swenson calls humanity's most fundamental drive -- sexuality, seen through the eyes of over thirty artists.
Wokka-wokka-wokka-wokka. I'm taking a break from the amazing Pac-Man Google Maps take-over to bring you what's buzzing in the art world. Read up and own the cocktail party this weekend! Here are our favorite stories of the week.
Yan Pei Ming is, perhaps, one of the best examples of what it means today to be an artist in a global world -- where human beings, in a particularly dramatic way, are confronting experiences of solitude and death.

I truly believe that the exhibition Defining Beauty
Most of us have heard of \Murphy's Law\ by now.  It goes; \Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\  It most circumstances the outcome of \Murphy's Law\ is little more than a minor inconvenience.
Like the folk musics of Spain and North America, the music of Wales has a long and deep connection with that of Ireland; from the bardic schools of the middle ages, which sent harpers and singers between them, to today's folk revival, the two countries have influenced each other unceasingly for centuries.
Noah Fischer has been working to expose the exploitative labor conditions that the Guggenheim has undertaken building its museum in Abu Dhabi, and is a strategist and organizer of direct actions on the topic of debt.

During the spellbinding evening, Pamuk mentioned that he does not really believe in utopias in general, and said that humanity has created \a hundred tons of memory,\ but only one hundred grams of utopia.


Perhaps the most recognizable poster created by Paul Rand is the one he made for IBM, with its clean iconic triad, the eye, the bee, with the alphabet letter M, striped to match the body of the bee, to complete the rhebus.


It is so odd to feel like an outsider on an issue that touched my life so profoundly and was at least a part of what Arthur Mitchell set out to address 46 years ago when he and Karel Shook cofounded The Dance Theatre of Harlem in the basement of a church in Harlem.

I saw a ghost, of a missing building from a boyhood memory -- something that Amazon might have retrofitted, today, if it were still there for the taking.


At last week's big soiree to celebrate Stockard Channing's prolific career, it seemed very fitting to call the event, \Six Degrees of Stockard Channing.\ In fact, after much calculating, it was discovered that Channing can be linked to every show on Broadway within six degrees.
I noticed immediately when I met him that Robert Dubac has a warmth about him that you don't expect from a comedian; maybe it's a result of his choice to live in Telluride, Colorado or perhaps its due to the fact that he is really a deep thinker with philosophical thoughts evident in his comedy.
Eva Schlegel is best known for her photographic portraits that focus in front or behind her subjects, but never on the subjects themselves. These create blurry images that are distinctly human, but devoid of self.
On Thursday, The Guggenheim Museum hosted its annual Young Collector's Party.  The evening supported The Guggenheim Museum in its pursuit to procure works by emerging contemporary artists.


When I first started creating an original folk opera, 1854, I knew I would need to do a lot of research.  After all, I was writing about a specific time on Martha's Vineyard that was populated with historical characters, many of whom still had family living on this island.
Much like the 1970s punk rock scene belonged to New York and Los Angeles was the birthplace of 1950s film noir, no locale is more synonymous with Modernism than Paris. Aspiring and established artists alike flocked from around the world to access the creative energy.
From the first few rhythmic beats of the opening track, \Go Far,\ I was hooked. Soulful sound? Check. Appealing, familiar tonality? Check. Thought-provoking and inspiring lyrics? Check.
Sacred Bones Records here in Brooklyn is one of my favorite record labels to emerge in recent years. One of their latest releases is Moonlust by The Holydrug Couple.
Truly Mr. Bando with 'KODO' producer Nobuyuki Nishimura achieved this with their amazing ensemble of 15 performers, who transformed from dragons to musician's, from athletes to actors. With excellent choreography by Kazumi Boy and lighting design by Kenichi Mashiko, the stage was truly trafficking magic.

It is unclear what the future holds for this Hunchback. Another Disney project, Newsies, went from Paper Mill to Broadway not so long ago. The same could happen for Hunchback, but then it could not. For his part, Scott Schwartz is just enjoying the ride.


As an artist who works outside, you always have one problem
The group's challenge was familiar to anyone in traditional music

Sean E. Zilke's new play is at once an indictment of the animalistic horrors committed by the human race and, adversely, the unbreakable bonds of a loving family. Through this production we are given a rare peek into the endless potential of an important creative voice.

The Royal Academy's Rubens and His Legacy raises more questions than answers and make me wonder why the English find it so difficult to understand or even tolerate him. The clearest example of this confusion comes from the exhibition's fiercest critic, The Guardian's Jonathan Jones.

In Casselman's case, the familiarity with textures, coupled with the thick, tactile, earthy nature of clay that he manipulated with rubber and metal-edged \ribs,\ naturally and eventually carried over to his unique approach to painting, which he has been exploring for over twenty-five years.

During the On the Twentieth Century revival -- a musical comedy vehicle about a vehicle -- any number of Broadway veterans, including Kristin Chenoweth and Peter Gallagher, are working at the top of their forms.  On the job and giving their all throughout, they're offering patrons plenty of cause to be entertained.
A union that is over a hundred years old should not put itself at risk of splitting apart, simply because of a hidebound leadership mired in the past. While the union movement across the country is in a fight for its life, the last thing it needs is for union leaders to hasten its demise.
The Audience has some interesting moments and a first-rate cast, but it is hard to see its relevance to a U.S. audience. It's doubtful many Americans know Harold Wilson or Anthony Eden.  That doesn't detract from Stephen Daldry's solid direction or Bob Crowley's august set design.




Art Central has kicked off in Hong Kong, a day ahead of Art Basel - positioning itself not as a rival but as a satellite showcase for less established artists, as well as some of the giants of global contemporary art.

Crime novelist Patricia Highsmith was renowned for her intense psychological thrillers, particularly her series featuring the murderer Tom Ripley, but she was also known for her reclusive, abrasive and even hateful personality.

What I find unique about painting on site is that I can observe and learn about a culture -- not only am I painting, but I am listening to the conversations and observing while also interacting directly with my subject.  The downside, at least on this trip were ants, flies, cats and rain.


While there were instances where one could reflect on the history Ungerer moved through, at other times, you could see your naked self reflected back in the work. There is an almost healing potion that absolves you of your pain by experiencing the Ungerer's placement of it.
Ron Arad may be known for the products he's designed in the past five decades, like the sleek Tom Vac chair he designed for Vitra in 1999 or the winding Bookworm shelf he created for Kartell in 1994, but in recent years the industrial designer has been exploring his artistic side.

Last year I had the pleasure and honor to become acquainted with Somi, an amazing jazz singer who was then about to release her album, The Lagos Music Salon. I found her to be thoughtful, sincere, and an awesome talent.
On St. Paddy's Day, Sonny Grosso along with the Irish eyes of the late Det. Egan and his namesake Cardinal Edward Egan, who recently passed, will all be smiling down on New York.
Of the twentieth-century art gods (Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marcel Duchamp, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol), Marcel Duchamp elicits no middle road. He is either revered as a godlike figure of contemporary art or disdained as a charlatan.
I look forward to the day when art imitates life and people with disabilities are not portrayed in film only as victims or the heroes, but also as the woman behind the counter, or the best friend, or the love interest. This is the true reality in our world. People with disabilities can be anyone.


As time goes on (six years to be exact), two women go from teacher to student to friends to equals and finally rivals, as the unthinkable happens and a huge betrayal occurs.
The Audience gives us Ms. Mirren, but is likely to be a one-shot arrow. The star's performance is more than enough to carry the day, and carry the play, to surefire success; while Elizabeth The Queen has her supporters and her detractors, Mirren's canny and well-rounded performance is sure to garner unanimous huzzahs.
Mr. Schwartz, thank you so much for your incredible music. It's brought me and countless others a great deal of joy and helped form incredible friendships that mean the world to us.

Rang Rasa incorporates two Sanskrit words that express an ecstatic spirituality achieved through color and the practice of one's art -- they also aptly define the aesthetic sensibilities and ethereal aspects of Natvar Bhavsar's work.
Though known as a photographer, Hamdy in fact creates photographic works that capture a kind of durational performance art. He's taken, for instance, thousands of photos of the desert that describe the infinitely wide color range of that terrain.
What one extracts from both series hinges on the definition that one brings to art. So, as in the case of any one of the Zaeefeh pieces, a literal reading would be one of disrespect if not blasphemy, putting what amounts to graffiti on the portraits of shahs.
The second in a series, Surveillance.02 is an exhibit of interdisciplinary artists whose practices incorporate camera, satellite, and drone to question corporate and state surveillance, and energy production. It is the result of three seeds, planted over the course of the past year and a half.
Ambition can be both exciting and theatrical -- a challenge Lin-Manuel Miranda has realized to great effect in the clever and electric musical Hamilton, now off-Broadway at the Public Theater.

The exhibition presents Bj\u00f6rk's oeuvre in many layers, with instruments, a theatrical presentation, an immersive sound experience, a focused audio guide, and related visualizations, from photography and music videos to new media works.
Concept-wise, it's intelligent and daring. Intelligent because of the metanarrative (a play about a play) that informs the whole thing. Bold because it shows how two negatives make a positive. It uses source material that was a box office flop and a critical disaster.
George Bernard Shaw's Man and Superman isn't produced very often, in part because of its length.  To be more precise, the entire script isn't frequently staged.  The third act, \Don Juan in Hell\--the sequence often considered responsible for its ungainly length--is, however, excerpted more than occasionally.

To see how pictures can change the reality, and make the history, just take a look at before and after of an iconic photo taken by Elliott Erwitt unearthed in Magnum's \Contact Sheets\ documentary.

It's been a few years now since I began paying for Spotify's premium service, and to my enormous surprise I think I've been converted. Sure, I still buy some CDs and download albums that I think I'll want in my \permanent\ collection. But most of my listening these days has been on Spotify. And, I've begun to understand why.
Blake Little's portraits of Craigslist models, a dog and a baby covered in honey are terrific. Beautiful work. But let's give credit to Karen Finley for the original idea... and for doing it first. Nearly 10 years ago, actually.
In advance of her show ONLY IN HEAVEN, Sara Zielinski had the chance to ask Sara Zielinski a few questions about the unique nature of the show. It takes place in her apartment and features a wide variety of media.

It's with this same kind of lightness that he approaches the piano bench. His curly, rebellious and untamed hair plays its own part in this unusual pianist's performances.
What is the life of a painting? In an artist's hands, a previously anonymous canvas and a random assortment of paint suddenly becomes not only an expression of an idea, but a commodity that often lives beyond the artist himself.
Mostly well done, Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing, directed by Sean Gray for the Long Beach Playhouse Mainstage Theatre, recounts the story of Henry (Noah Wagner), a brilliant and celebrated playwright.
His latest effort is a full-fledged concept album. Hand. Cannot. Erase. is nothing short of an epic tale\u00a0of modern-day isolation. Wilson wrote the songs from a female perspective, finding inspiration for the concept and story in the\u00a0fascinating case of Joyce Carol Vincent.
The sight never fails to thrill

Recent catastrophes like the lockouts in Minnesota and Atlanta at least brought to the fore questions about how to fund these organizations, what can be cut and what can't be cut, what one community can manage (rather than a cookie-cutter approach), what a community needs and thus will stretch for.
It seems Kimberly was destined to play bold, brassy, determined ladies of the twentieth century - -women who defied the odds of class, ethnicity and appearance to get exactly where they wanted to go.

As I walked up the familiar steps and entrance everything seemed as it had been during my time as a student.  The inside, however, was quite different and the courtyard was bathed in light, still surrounded by some familiar artwork.

I just learned from Alexandra Hildebrandt Hoy, Fred Hildebrandt's daughter, that her father did not write a diary account of this Canadian camping trip with Norman Rockwell in 1934. By this account, the diary that Deborah Solomon refers to in her biography of my grandfather does not exist; it never did.

Mention bellydancing to most Americans and they'll envision sultry slave girls in a James Bond movie or sex workers in a tawdry lap dance club.
With The Last Five Years, Lagravanese was aiming small. He wasn't seeking out the mall crowds but that bijou contingent of folks who can tell the difference between Kelli O'Hara and Patti Lupone.
Western Society, like its namesake, actually requires your participation in the system to make meaning. Western Society has four performers -- like the four original viewers of the video -- who have now brought this slice of life reality to a broader audience.
A Noise Within, one of the nation's premier classical repertory companies, has mounted an ambitious, if somewhat tame, revival of the Brecht/Weill classic.  With a solid ensemble cast, the company mounts a faithful and spirited rendition of the timeless Threepenny Opera.
Almost immediately after Tom Stoppard's new and intellectually thrilling play, The Hard Problem, at the National Theatre's Dorfman, begins, the just-about-peerless playwright has his characters discourse on the title's reference.  It's a good thing he does.
Stanton is the author of a New York Times bestseller, with a Facebook page with 12 million followers and a partnership with the United Nations. But his story hasn't always been so glamorous.
At the end of the show, the cast sings \Say Goodbye to the Scottsboro Boys.\ It is an entertaining, show biz, but powerfully complex number, infused with anger. It grabs the audience. The actors have done what they have set out to do. They have told their story their way.
When Peter Barnes decided the ruling English class was nutty, he created Jack Gurney and wrote The Ruling Class, a hellzapoppin satire during most of which Gurney (James McAvoy) contends he's Jesus.

The quantum wave cresting for the past two years in Berlin collapsed in the EVENT that was the 65th Internationale Filmfestspiele Berlin.
Looking at Brett Novak's work, the most astonishing thing is the beauty of his cinematic gaze. His videos act both as a reflection of and a medium between capturing the experience of skateboarding and different places and their spatial potential.





Becoming a modern nation does not mean acquiring Western trappings wholesale. It does not mean discarding Chinese values. Today's China has roots that stretch back thousands of years and unite the Chinese as a people.

Roiling fog, cars speeding across iconic bridges, late night cityscapes, all of these are commonplace in a city time-lapse. What makes Gotham City SF different is that all of this happens in black and white -- almost unheard of in time-lapse these days -- with an original soundtrack worthy of the next TRON movie.
We wanted to take the best photograph ever taken in Myanmar.   My guide, MM, and I were tired of the same stale images being photographed of his country over and over.  We felt we could do something better and if not better at least more original. Of course we are as guilty as all the other photographers that took the same tried and true photographs, great images initially but ones that were starting to bore us.

I recently interviewed Dennis Hare, and asked him about his background, artistic development and influences.
Millions of Americans tuned in for the Grammys, and many were dazzled, amazed, and touched by the emotionally-charged, nude leotard clad performance of Sia's Chandelier by Kristen Wiig and Maddie Ziegler.
When I was at college, a favorite pastime of mine was sitting around with a bunch of other procrastinators keen on determining the most important person of the 20th century.  I maintained it was Winston Churchill.
I have now and then heard artists likened to the demiurge - Plato's word for the divinity that made the cosmos. This never made a visceral impression on me until I saw how Assael paints. He summons an image the way the Genesis demiurge summons the universe.




Georgia O'Keeffe was a 28 year old Wisconsin farm girl; Alfred Stieglitz was a 52 year old New York bon vivant. Stieglitz intimately photographed his muse throughout their tumultuous, erotically charged marriage.

So often plugged in and invested in distraction, who will be our poets? So many seek to live through the experiences of others, maniacal about sharing snippets of their lives, but in curated photos of a desired life, an avoidance of the present. What of the moment of experience?
That first night, when everyone buzzed around the hospital, I thought about whom I'd give my books to. I thought about who'd miss me the most. I thought who'd take care of Doris. No one. Nothing. Blank. Blank.

Photographer Sarah Elise Abramson's aesthetic is at the intersection of the poetic and unsettling, the creepy and beautiful, the subversive and classically Romantic.

The exhibition Paul Gauguin at Fondation Beyeler in Riehen (Basel, Switzerland) is one of the highlights of the art year 2015. The show brings together about fifty masterpieces by Paul Gauguin from leading international museums and private collections such as the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris.
If forgiveness is divine, what is the inability to forgive?  Joe Pintauro's hard-nosed Snow Orchid, at the Lion, doesn't provide an answer.  Instead, through the up-close-and-extremely-personal look at one severely dysfunctional family, it offers a relentless example of the absence of forgiveness.


Nora de Angelli is a London-based freelance photographer and documentary filmmaker. Until 2011, when she graduated from London College of Communication's University of Arts, with an M.A. in Documentary Film under her belt, De Angelli was an accomplished research scientist.

Paris has a new, state-of-the-art concert hall, something the French have been waiting for since they dispatched Louis XVI in 1793, thus making possible government- funded arts venues for the people.

Nation to Nation; Treaties Between the United States and American Indian Nations, the recently installed exhibition at the National Museum of the American Indian, is one of the most difficult and troubling exhibitions I've ever experienced. It is also the best history exhibition I've seen at the Smithsonian.



These aspects of the production were what made the adaptation work best for me. In film, special effects can make flying vampires look naturally at home in an otherwise realistic world. This is harder in an intimate theatre space.
A vibrant culture is poised for its next great moment


I first discovered photographer Tanya Habjouqa in Florence, where her photo exhibit was showcased during the Middle East Now Film Festival.
If you go by Ivan Turgenev's A Month in the Country, revived at Classic Stage Company, you might conclude the revered Russian literary man was more of a city lover.
The Great Escape, by design or by happenstance, is perfect for Top 40 radio.  It's commercial and mainstream, while distinctive enough to avoid being classified as familiar or, worse, ordinary.
I Am Love just released a self-titled album which reflects their personal tastes in music

When the public reads stories in the media about visual artists, it is all too often about art stars that are selling their works for six-figure sums or an item detailing glamorous parties on the art fair circuit.

Lunch with Andy Warhol. Some thirteen years later, after the Fair, I was invited to join a half-a-dozen hip, arty, New York types for a midday meal with Andy Warhol. I pride myself on a surefire, rock hard memory. My mind's eye never lets me down.
Reaching new audiences requires reaching outside of oneself, and beyond the conventional way of doing things. So at Fifth House Ensemble, we're always looking to collaborate with people who bring their own, unique talents to the table.
What \Bull's Head\ did for art 70 years ago may have, knowingly or unconsciously relied on the same sensationalism as today's sensationalistic art, however the innovation level was an order of magnitude higher.

\Letters of Sacrifice\ is Hassin's tribute to those who have fought and died for our country in all wars, but represents those who have fallen since that infamous September day almost 14 years ago.
Yes, this is obviously going to be another one of those actors-play-the-instruments affairs, which have become dime-a-dozen since John Doyle did it in 2004 with Sondheim's Sweeney Todd. In this Into the Woods, though, the device works well.

In 2014, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival invited audiences to spend time with three women who, as a result of having defied parental authority, were forced to deal with severe repercussions to their rebelliousness.

Robert Adams' contribution to contemporary photographic practice, especially in the U.S., cannot be underestimated, no matter its modest appearance or echoes of the private and personal.


As a personal historian, I've had many people tell me that they regret not knowing more of their family stories. I hope this project encourages people to take an active interest in their family history. Because the more we know about our family history, the more we know about ourselves.
I escaped the cornfields to pursue more intense arts education at Interlochen Arts Academy, then, after college, I joined the Peace Corps. I had a very idealistic vision of how my service would change the world (I was 22, after all).

Kathleen Turner is one of my favorite actresses and Molly Ivins was a hero. I had the pleasure of seeing Kathleen Turner in Red Hot Patriot the Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins at the Berkeley Rep. Here are 10 things I learned.
What would be the meaning of an \original work\ tomorrow if the copy is identical to the original and if being provided with an off-the-shelf technical device is sufficient to reproduce the original? Why would the original be more expensive than the copy? How is it possible to insure effectively against fakes?
Ray Turner paints with a quiet bravado, daring himself to conjure coherent and easily comprehended imagery from a froth of paint.
The thing Broadway producers don't seem to fathom (as reported in Patrick Healy's article in The New York Times January 7th) is that musicals by their very nature are not always feel-good events.  And so The Last Ship will inevitably sink on Jan. 24 after a four-month run.
Mindfulness helps me acknowledge my self-critical distractions, embrace the present of momentary sensations, scents, feelings, inhales, and then exhale it into my writing.
Thinking about Cuba is like trying to sort through the bits and pieces thrown haphazardly together in a data junk yard. Everyone has an opinion about this morality play. Actually, it's more of a cartoon except for the deeply tragic element.

The one thing that is clear, people are dissatisfied with the status quo and starving for invigorating art. The best movies of the year were about struggling to produce art in a world that doesn't put much value in it.



Profanity is never far from profundity. It's something that you discover quickly in exploring the imagination of the great Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini, who was as immersed in both the highest and lowest strivings of the human spirit.

Two films recently screened for Bay area audiences gave new meaning to the old saying that \He who laughs last, laughs best.\

This is an extraordinary time in the dance world, when five of the greatest ballerinas of our time, from leading American ballet companies, have, coincidentally, all announced their retirement within months of each other.
And so it goes -- another production of Side Show leaves us. Its cult status will remain, untouched by mainstream attention. This is no surprise to those of us who follow such things. In fact, the surprise was that it came at all.

As technology allows us to erect more and more electronic barriers around us, the value of removing one's earbuds and looking up from one's smartphone becomes increasingly important. Some people understand how to use new technology while others remain decidedly unclear on the concept.

As much as I love Meryl, I'm never going to buy her records, and I haven't been this uncomfortable watching her in a film since, what do you know, Mama Mia! If we're living in any sort of movie musical cinema revival, it's time to start asking ourselves what we sacrificed to get there.
New York arts lawyer Thomas C. Danziger received a telephone call late one night in 2009 from \a guy in a hotel in Hong Kong\ who discovered he had a legal problem.

\By photographing these marginal details; stains, traces, dust, dirt, I bring them to the center of vision, allowing them to exist and prevail,\ she says, in an attempt to foreground \the abjectness of the otherwise invisible.\
There is a pedagogic nature to the writing, as the pieces teach you what they are about as they go along, and they are written in spiral form, whereby each successive phrase, and quartet, is an elaboration or development on the previous.


Directed by Mark Kenward, the performance that I attended at the 2014 San Francisco Fringe Festival of Caggiano's new monologue felt like a crash landing that kept passing through a series of green spotlights as it bumped and lurched down an ill-fated runway.
I have a secret; how not only to avoid the stress connected with holiday shopping, but instead, to enjoy it. Yes, to enjoy Holiday shopping! Are you ready? Do you have a pen and paper handy?

\I always try to remain conscious of the tools I have at hand

Seeing Kunkle's work in person, I immediately understand that these are paintings which speak different languages, exude a variety of moods as the days pass.
Of all the things that occurred over the first half of the decade in the arts, what will be the most impactful at the end of the decade? It is hardest to see from the middle of it all but I will take a stab.




Guillermo Kuitca's work is present in the collections of major museums including the Metropolitan Museum, MoMA, Tate Gallery ... But the most interesting thing about Kuitca is that, thanks to him, future generations of Argentine artists have formed.
And as people argue that so much mainstream music today has become all about superficialities (at least in my circle, they do), more about image and marketing than expression, we are forced to say goodbye to a man who epitomized the real and gritty.

Perhaps Big Eyes is not the best-crafted piece of art. It may seem disproportionate in features and at points, tawdry and even uneven. However, not only is this film important, it is urgent.
Having opened the window to everyone, art and the internet has evolved from the side of a building or a subway car to land on our desktops and smartphones. We can carry aesthetics, creativity and ideology with us everywhere.
\I am experiencing a kind of crisis,\ Tchaikovsky wrote gloomily, after being ordered by the tzar's flunkeys to compose a ballet score for a flimsy tale centred around children, rats and a candy kingdom. After the glory of The Sleeping Beauty, the Nutcracker commission seemed like an insult.
We all know there's more than one downside to the omnipresent smartphone--the invention of the 'selfie', the calloused thumbs, the inability to bullshit our way through a discussion about, well, anything that can be Googled.\n\nBut you know what my favorite upside is? The ability to take a picture at any given moment. No, I'm not talking about catching a nominee for the 'People of Wal-Mart' blog; I'm talking about taking pictures of my kids.

Her skirts are short; her boyfriends are young; her fingernails are long; and her energy is endless. Nikki is always overdressed and ready to go. Her motto is \Never give in. Never give up. And never take 'no' for an answer.\ If Nikki can't do it in high heels; she's not interested

A good half-century after it started, Roland Reiss's career continues to surprise and delight in a new exhibition at Diane Rosenstein gallery. The last time I caught up with this artist's work, a couple of years ago, he was already painting, um... flowers.
Conceived, directed and choreographed by Andrea Luna and Angela Lopez, it's a riot of song, a rhapsody of dance and movement. In short, it's a scream. It recovers and re-enacts the delightfully sinister Victorian winter solstice tradition.
For many years, Ramona Otto was an elementary school teacher. Full disclosure

For Smith and Emin, the body is in perpetual motion. Neither artist has any shame in laying the ghastliest aspects of femininity stripped bare. This introspection strips their work of pretense down to an almost primeval level.

The biggest change we are seeing today with the contemporary artist's approach to the landscape is how they relate this time-tested type to some sort of political statement, while other artists see it as a way to express the land's power and beauty.
The world was a different place in 1999. New York was a different place. But one constant in the city has been Beats in Space, Tim Sweeney's weekly mix of eclectic house, disco, hip-hop, techno and dance floor friendly anthems, broadcast through WNYU.
For Monty Python fans, Eric Idle is a wacky kind of genius.


Street art is not what you expect to encounter in the elegant lobby of Santa Monica's luxurious Hotel Casa del Mar, which makes the hotel's newly installed temporary street art installation a most welcome surprise.

For its final show of 2014, David Zwirner's London gallery is showing Swedish artist Jockum Nordstr\u00f6m's first UK solo show.

Now at the Booth Theater, The Elephant Man, which won the Tony for Best Play in 1979, is effective because it isn't literal. Cooper doesn't wear a prosthetic; instead, the audience imagines his disfigurement as he contorts his body. And people gasp in horror at the sight of him.

It's the first theatrical documentary of its kind, and it will no doubt open the door for other films on the subject of feminism and women's liberation.

You don't have to adhere to predestination to accept the notion that subliminal forces, for good or bad, may play a more important role in the unfolding of your fate than naked will.

It's 2014. If you're like me, you've  probably heard about all you can of the songs Fancy, Chandelier and anything Pitbull. Don't give up though, there is some exceptionally great stuff out there.

Recent studies by Americans for the Arts, Giving USA, and others have drawn welcome public attention to the role of corporate giving in the creative ecology -- some sounding alarms and others offering rays of hope.

Each writer I know offers an open door into their extended world, full of their most treasured ideas and images. Writers share what they find most valuable. In that spirit, I'm sharing 10 great books with you and paying it forward for the writers -- and artists -- who have created them.
U.S. Air Force men and women fly and maintain some of the most sophisticated aircraft in the world. They do many other things and do them well. One of them is playing beautiful music, and singing beautifully, as the U.S. Air Force Band recently did at the National Air and Space Museum on December 2.
Every aspect of the Found Theatre is a labor of love. So too is Mike Brown's direction. He filmed hundreds of hours of the production's cast meetings and rehearsals. As he said in his opening night preamble, he didn't know what he would do with the footage, it just seemed important.

\I think that the youngest members of our society are increasingly worried about making their way in the world, and their anxiety is shaping the way that some of them approach being an artist.\
I've come to admire people, and theater companies, that take the risk. You have to hand it to Elliott -- more than any other major off-Broadway theater company, The New Group consistently produces offbeat works.
I'm happy projects like this take a step toward educating people, and take many steps toward supporting AIDS/HIV services and research organizations through sales proceeds.
While working on my new film in the Bay Area this summer, I had the good fortune of being introduced to Stephen Parr and his massive 6000 sq. ft. archive aptly named Oddball Films.
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival's revival of Stephen Sondheim's iconic musical, now playing at the Wallis Annenberg Center in Beverly Hills, is an uneven, if often delightful, rendition of Sondheim's parable of the trials and tribulations of childhood and growing up.
Come Christmas every year, new offerings are presented with the hope they'll become holiday perennials.

Being a curator just happened. I was interested in architecture and design, and slowly, but surely, realized I became a curator because it was another way to communicate the belief that design is important and endlessly inspiring.
I saw it first. Well, not quite. The rapturous critical reception that has greeted the revival of Side Show on Broadway takes me back, way back, to a demonstration of Side Show's unique power that I witnessed firsthand quite some time ago.

Our existence derives its meaning from use, for this reason a glass bellows when it is used even for mundane activities as opposed to a china set that is reserved for the grandest of balls. Seemingly important yet so impotent, a parody of life.

Seconds later, Sarah slowly comes to the door and welcomes me into her home with open arms and a slight smile.

Photography books are expensive, really expensive. I've collected dozens and dozens over the years and I kind of feel as though I have tied up a lot of money in books.

Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself is a fascinating investigation of a literary figure who never really got his due.

I'm often amused by the random juxtaposition of shows I attend from one night to the next. One could hardly position two American musicals that differ quite as much in their performance history, style, and appeal than the two I saw in back-to-back performances a few months ago.


What kind of space -- literary, cultural, socio-political, psycho-emotional -- does a Nepali writing in English have in Nepal? And in the world?


Thinking is not always associated with abstract expressionism. After all, the technique was called \action painting\ and it's quarterback, Jackson Pollock, was intentionally or unintentionally rough around the edges.
If you look at Renaissance artworks that depict Jesus, you will not find any evidence of a Jew inside the Christianized Jesus -- even though the Gospels in the New Testament tell us that Jesus was Jewish to the core.
The city was the co-star. On August 14, 1978, the dynamic duo was talking quietly about the staging of the next shot. We were on East 58th near the end of the street. It was almost dawn. The 59th Street Bridge loomed large in the background with its existing lights defining it in a majestic, urban way.

Dressed as their religion dictates, they set up their own equipment, they had no roadies, and from what I understand they couldn't play from sundown Friday to Saturdays because of the Sabbath.

We creatives don't like to think of ourselves in those terms. We have a love/hate relationship with personal branding and ourselves as product (if the audience doesn't want what I have, well screw 'em).
With so many people listening to music through earbuds, I frequently wonder if any of them have a library of music resting within their memory that they can access without the help of an electronic device.
I'm a painter, so of course I find statements about the death of painting annoying, but also sloppy thinking, since painting is what it takes to be able to even make the statement.

Stories of the Hollywood blacklist of the 1940s and '50s are, by now, well known. Many books, articles and documentaries exist about the lives of actors who the studios deemed unemployable because of their association with the Communist Party.
It takes place in a small room. No windows, no mirrors, no way out. Uptown Estelle (Genevieve Simon) is attracted to Garcin (Anthony B. Cohen). Inez (Natalie Beisner) is attracted to Estelle.

Give it up for Anna Fishbeyn, who manages to turn painful memoir into an insightful, entertaining show.
From the early civilization days, human beings believed in culture. Every society practiced one or the other form of art or craft.

After opens like a horror story. An ominous undertow pervades its early frames, giving us the feeling we are watching a scary movie that will tighten its screws and escalate our dread until something too terrifying to endure occurs.











In the past two years Instagram has shot to mainstream popularity. For those who may have just recently jumped on the bandwagon, you may not know that Instagrams' early adopters were photographers.
What you see is definitely not an orange.


The truth is that for the average person, visiting a local art show or museum means just admiring the artist's passion, celebrating their creative growth, and maybe searching for some inspiration for your own artistic or personal endeavors.
When someone's said to be quixotic, it's meant that they're too impractical and idealistic for their own good. Enter Man of La Mancha, written by Dale Wasserman, with words and music by Joe Darion and Mitch Leigh.



Bertolt Brecht's \The Threepenny Opera,\ directed by Eric Hamme for the Garage Theatre IN COLLISION WITH Alive Theatre, offers a rambunctiously cynical look at London's demimonde, at the corporatization of its street beggars, at the doings of its criminal underworld.
A blog and video that recently appeared on the HuffingtonPost Arts page -- Why Leonardo Da Vinci Was A Loser (And What That Means For You) -- has apparently re-ignited a longstanding feud between Leonardo da Vinci and his frenemy Michelangelo.
Accuracy is tossed out the window along with nuance, leaving audiences to either suspend reason and swallow sagas whole, or watch at a remove, uncertain which parts are (sort of) true, and which are fabricated to hit those bullet points deemed essential to commercial success.


With the pervasiveness of gender inequality in nearly every arena, it's heartening to know that there are passionate individuals and organizations out there working hard to affect change.
According to Kander and Ebb, \If I can make it there, I'd make it anywhere.\ Perhaps more than anything else, that sentiment lies at the core of two new films seen at the 2014 San Francisco International Film Festival.

The portrait genre was born out of a primal urge of conquering the biggest obstacle of life -- namely death.

With the strong British influence throughout ABT's history -- it currently counts its Macmillan and Ashton repertory among its greatest strengths -- it is no surprise that ABT has focused on the narrative potential of the work.
Rising stars, in their own right, Rez Ones and Boogie's lives are already on display and getting involved with someone that shares their passion and lifestyle can be a blessing and a curse. When it's good, it's great.


The San Francisco Opera recently revived John Copley's 1987 production of Verdi's masterpiece (commissioned by Terry McEwen) as part of its 2014 summer season. Not having seen this particular production since it came online nearly 25 years ago, I had looked forward to getting reacquainted with its charms.
Jeff Koons and Kara Walker are far from the first artists to explore the concept of life and death in their artwork. In fact, this concept is the very essence of what the art world constantly seeks to investigate.
Before he began writing as well as directing his celebrated movies, Preston Sturges uncorked Strictly Dishonorable, a hit Broadway show.  It was such a click that although it opened a little more than a month before the October 1929 stock market crash, it ran until January 1931.
I only showed up out of polite interest as a Sturges fanatic, wondering if glimmers of his genius would be visible. Indeed, his sparkling, distinctive gift for dialogue and whiplash changes in emotion from sincere to silly are on full display.


The first experience of a Mutoid Waste installation may  trigger a load of reactions. Often it starts with the inevitable \wow\ of disbelief. After a few seconds, when reality has somehow kicked back in, this disbelief morphs into pure joy and then a sense of playfulness.

Watching Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (Humpty Sharma's Bride), a Bollywood romantic comedy written and directed by Shashank Khaitan, is like watching soccer. It's got a huge playing field, the clock keeps ticking, and there's always something going on.

This month marks the first anniversary of the Barbara Prey Gallery on Main Street in Williamstown, Massachusetts.  Opening a gallery was not something I had honestly planned.

\You have to practice finishing,\ Tiler reminds the toe students after a series of turns, \you can't just stop in mid-step and freeze.\ A good lesson for life as well as ballet.

The Bearded Ladies cabaret has an carved out an avid theater following in Philadelphia in just a couple of years. The nine-member troupe explores the many traditions and forms the art of cabaret can take, even for the opera stage.





For this ongoing project titled \Reality and Imagination,\ photographer Leslie Jean-Bart spends hours at Coney Island, studying the sea, the sand, the boardwalk, the people, their interactions.
Krupin and Caraballo have a vision of electronic dance music (EDM) that refreshes people through movement and sound, a vision of dance music that leaves people with a cleared mind and increased connection with the universe.
Direct, immediate, nuanced, and responsive to the artist's hand, water-based mediums defy attempts at revision, demanding that the artist work quickly and intuitively, and be acutely present in the moment.

Under the expert curatorial guidance of Ed Budz, the Thalia theater at Symphony Space is offering a remarkable cinematic series this summer. Appropriately if prosaically titled Classics in HD, it includes some of the most memorable films in 20th century film history.

Erizku is a photographer and a self-reflective curator.  He tells me that he envisioned his show as a mixtape - he's got some hits mixed in with some tracks that he might need to convince you are worth a listen.


I can understand your frustrations if the gadflies are harping on the implications of your rebrand. I never intended to offend or titillate my viewers either; rather I wanted to set myself a part from others.

\u010cechomor marked their 25th year as a band in 2013, and they celebrated with another live concert and recording project, their most ambitious in a career of ambitious projects

I was wondering recently what might be gleaned from them if they were considered individually. This is the reality of how they're most often exhibited and reproduced now anyways.
My favorite course in college was one of the obvious and simple ones

Jos\u00e9 Luis \Katira\ Ram\u00edrez was serving as the governor of his community of San Andr\u00e9s Cohamiata, Jalisco, when he met Argentine filmmaker Hern\u00e1n Vilchez. He was not like any governor Vilchez had ever met.

With the debut of the cable series Masters of Sex, any purely art historical Google search for risque old master paintings is now totally skewed to the Showtime television program.
As someone who has been working in this industry for the past 15 years, I wanted to share with all of you some of the tidbits I wished someone had told me when I was starting out. Brace yourselves - it's not all pretty.
The more I've evolved as a person, the more I've embraced my humanity and know many of my character defects are simply survival skills gone awry. Unbeknownst to me, the more I accepted myself, the tighter I gripped my paintbrushes





In an attempt to bring together compelling examples of this trend, I asked a number of artists from various parts of the world to answer four questions with the hopes of clarifying this ever-increasing phenomenon of repurposing with a passion.
When are the sirens going to go off next? How can this ever end? Will our lives always be interrupted by these sirens? Weddings, openings of festivals, can we have major events? Will normality ever return?


I spoke with Munson about her new work, a story of poetry, memories and the intergenerational connection of family.
Old habits die hard. Especially when the habits are religious traditions and the agents of change seek to persecute those traditions. \Fiddler on the Roof,\ written by Joseph Stein, music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, directed by Phyllis B. Gitlin for the Long Beach Playhouse Mainstage Theatre, is a moving and painful account of the conflict.

Engagement comes in the unfolding of these richly drawn lives, and the nostalgic reviewing of our own. It all seems so real, and yet, Boyhood is scripted in its major moments, with improvisation from the actors.

In coping with many of the issues we face, urban mayors spend much time focusing on the live and work part of growing their cities, but the play portion is similarly important, especially when it comes to the arts.




There is no better time for a film festival in Ukraine, even if it would appear to be during such a volatile moment in the country's history.



If the Devil had a band that doubled as a theater production company, that company might the The Drunkards Wife, for nothing this delightfully experimental could be considered holy.
While each of these dramas deals with weighty issues, it's no surprise to hear the audience frequently laughing during the performance. Is it because one man's tragedy is another man's comedy? Or because human beings, in their most fallible moments, are a constant source of wonder and entertainment?
William Shakespeare historians have tried and failed to find a figure during the reigns of Henry IV and Henry V who might have been the inspiration for Sir John Falstaff, whom many of the playwright's advocates consider the preeminent Shakespeare character.
Bilkis Ahmed aka Bobby (Vidya Balan) wants to be a detective. But there are obstacles. First, her training. She has none, a point her boss from the agency where she wanted to work pounds home. Second, her gender. She's a woman.



I like to think Washington and Franklin would be proud as we celebrate our great country this weekend with music, with art, with community. It's a very American thing to do.

American film aficionados (and Academy members) seem predisposed to view Israeli film in a specific light -- that of the conflict. That makes sense. It's sensational, tragic and ongoing. But this leaves American audiences with a skewed view.
The magic of GHOST, both the film and musical production, is the chilling sensation you get watching the hero fight for the woman he loves from beyond the grave.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Pianist and repertoire specialist Ghenady Meirson has been the go to-master for two decades in Philadelphia for authentic Russian operatic repertoire.
The earliest memory Rose has of creating art was when she was five-years old. She would sit with pencils in her hand and draw and draw until she was exhausted.

A month later, Darrow handed me an X-Men comic book opened to an early page. I was stunned. There I was. My face, my hair, my physique. But on the page I wasn't a student and a personal trainer, I was Dr. Cecilia Reyes.
I continue to believe that jazz is an art form that has become the most internationally cooperative means of communication in the world today. As artists and listeners alike have found out it can be a tremendously spiritual medium allowing us to transcend everyday life with beauty and connectivity.
The rain in the beginning of New York's summer season occurs often and prodigiously. It doesn't however, impede the progress or plans of the average Gotham pedestrian.

Send a clear, concise well-formatted email that focuses on highlights from the season, including some photographs, to donors (and key prospects), volunteers, board members, subscribers and key press. This is a very inexpensive and easy way to celebrate the year just finished.

It's summer. That means we need beach type entertainment material. Navigable, fun, not too ponderous. It also means road trips, planned as much as one can plan a road trip, a chance to connect with family, and, also, fun.

Politicians, warriors and self-important fools frequently fail to learn anything from the past. But for creative types, the past offers a wondrous portal which invites them to explore science and history (as well as the history of comparative religion, costume design, distant cultures and lots more).


Mary Rodgers died yesterday, at the age of 83.  I do hope that her book is forthcoming, as she was a firsthand observer of and participant in our musical theater world.  And one who was willing to speak candidly, with good nature and humor.
Today, saying you want to be a full-time art professor is basically like saying you want to be an A-list movie star.


Political films tend to create a black and white universe and Burning Bush is rescued from being a lives of the saints, employing the Czech penchant for ambivalence and irony, which serve to broaden its moral spectrum
If you haven't seen this series of videos, they're a great learning/teaching resource on the painting techniques of the Abstract Expressionists -- specifically Pollock, Newman, Rothko, Reinhardt and Kline -- by Corey d'Augustine of The Museum of Modern Art, New York.
If you've ever been to an event in Center City that included a reception, such as opening night at the theater or an art gallery, you know how much fun they can be.


While many arts institutions may have the same general goals (sell more tickets, raise more money, etc.) the path to achieving these goals will differ markedly from one organization to another.
When people think about artistic achievement, many focus on an individual's triumph in winning an award to recognize his talent. The truth is that the road leading up to that person's moment of glory was paved with the input of many others.
Barcel\u00f3 Con Hielo, written by Marco Antonio Rodriquez, who also plays Nino, poignantly delves into the tricky torment of memory with both humor and pathos. Rodriquez posits a family drama in which two sons, the responsible Sergio, a young painter, and irresponsible Dennis, cope with their ailing father.
When I look at works of art I am more interested than ever in a single question



This year, S\u00f3nar highlighted a very modern reality
On June 18, 2014 the American Film Institute offered audiences the opportunity to become familiar with the truth when its five-day documentary festival in Washington D.C. opened with an instant classic.
This anonymous little store will endure as the truest testament of what was there and all that was lost. It stands as the purest expression of memory possible

\When the Stars Begin to Fall
Given the North American urban renaissance, how much development can the highly desirable edge of a park absorb? How much vertical aspiration can our horizontal ideal accommodate?


I like to imagine that the collected works of @NeinQuarterly will make their way into a dissertation one day, perhaps written by an earnest graduate student interested in U.S.-German cultural relations as mediated by the internet in the 2010s.

If Joe Beck somehow had the desire, the dream to leave one last recorded legacy of what this music really meant to him, then surely the brilliantly recorded Get Me is a wonderfully realized dream.

Despite LaBute's unfortunate script, Power Plays is an overall enjoyable, light night at the theatre. The 75-minute runtime and affordable price make this an easy night of live theatre.


Kara Walker's sugar sphinx descended upon Brooklyn last month, bringing well over 35 tons of sweetness to the cavernous darkness of the old Domino Sugar Factory.
I first saw Wilson's play during its 1987 pre-Broadway tryout at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco with James Earl Jones in the lead role. At the time, I found it difficult to appreciate Wilson's play.


Stylistic versatility has penetrated one discipline after another
I struggled to write this article. I was imagining people scouring the article for every little thing I did wrong. I was constantly questioning the worth and validity of what I had to say.  I'm still doing it as I write this.
The photographer on the beach that day was Bunny Yeager and the model was 32-year old Bettie Page. This iconic image is included in the exhibition \Bunny's Bombshells\ at Sin City Gallery in Las Vegas.

This exhibition proposes that artists are mapmakers, their works, maps, and their audience, orienteers. It also suggests a correlation between its content and form. If maps and mapping strategies are the content, then a virtual exhibition is its form.

A new trend is rising in Israeli cinema. While the world is, for the most part, more interested in Israeli films on the topic of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Israel's real cinematic success is coming from stories of life in Israel outside the conflict.







Few artists paint from the perspective that \You're only as big as the canvas that's facing you.\ Sculpted by the father-and-son team of Gutzon and Lincoln Borglum, the Mount Rushmore National Memorial is one of the few exceptions to the rule.
In Burkina Faso, dancer Salimata Wologem fills the room when she moves. Whatever the choreography, the forcefulness of her dancing depicts an individual conquering the limitations of space and society.

My Generation

It's hard to imagine the Southern California music scene without Jacaranda's \Music at the Edge of Santa Monica\ shaping and defining it.
Many of the films that are shown in the Cannes competition and parallel sections are difficult and challenging to watch. This is a festival that encourages artistic freedom and there is always that one movie that will blow everyone away.

Sebastian Junger has managed to find intriguing angles on the deployment and on the longest military commitment in U.S. history in Korengal, which opened on Friday. The new film offers some sober reflection to the visceral jolt that came with Restrepo.
To Egyptian audiences Hefzy offers a new type of movie, modern and urban, while to the rest of the world a blend of wonderfully written characters and slice-of-life poetic interpretations of today's land of chaos and humanity, so often watched on the news and yet so seldom understood.
Rem Koolhaas deconstructs buildings to see what makes them work.
You could say things ended well.
In the year following the release of Jimi Hendrix's third masterpiece album, Electric Ladyland, it was apparent that the band with which he had skyrocketed to fame, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, had ceased to exist
Clark Hulings was an American master painter who was said to be able to describe air itself with paint. Surviving, even thriving, as a realist painter throughout the second half of the 20th century was no easy feat but Hulings had the talent and dedication.
Mickey Birnbaum returns with the stunningly brilliant and hilarious tale of teenage backyard wrestling in the wasteland of San Diego's border suburbs.  Birnbaum's gift for dialogue and unsentimental character portrayal is on full display here, as he dissects with great humor and insight the lives of a family of lost souls.

William Inge is a dark chronicler of small-town Midwest lives. The roles of alcohol and sexual impropriety are familiar threads in his work -- a striking contrast to the white-picket fence world of assumed propriety.

April Nordbee, a 29-year-old mother of two who lives in Wisconsin, has found her life completely changed over the past two years, all as the result of a lucky keystroke error she made during a Google search that caused her to discover the life and work of artist Marcel Duchamp.

A popular show business axiom insists that \Dying is easy, comedy is hard.\ While any performer who has bombed onstage will quickly acknowledge this bitter truth, the bottom line is that comedy depends on good ideas and solid execution.
Forbidden Broadway Comes Out Swinging! pays homage to the very institution it savages. Only a passionate theater lover could pen such a smart, insightful score, and Alessandrini shares his thoughts about the show's longevity.

The show ends, sweetly if not a little sadly, with the two of them outside, not in front of a miniature, black and white screen. The father teaches the son the names of the trees on his property.

There has never been a movie that has so impeccably captured the feeling of being 13 years old. Frame by frame, Lukas Moodyson immerses his audience in the ocean of na\u00efve rage that pulsates in the hearts of three pubescent punks.
Over the past few years, the artistic talent and creative drive has been on the rise in North Jersey. Young filmmakers are producing high quality content with nothing more than a few pieces of necessary production equipment and some passion to bring stories to life through picture and sound.
Benjamin Brand's play, based on the 2001 incident in Germany in which a man agreed to be killed and eaten by another man (dubbed the Rotenberg Cannibal) has been justifiably praised for impeccable performances by Donal Thoms-Cappello and Chris L. McKenna, as well as for the audacious tackling of the subject matter by Brand.

Guess it's blowin' in the zeitgeist, but two adaptations involving rhymed classics are available in Manhattan this weekend only and worth any theatergoer's precious time.
This week Ballet to the People settled into the Met for three back-to-back performances by a beloved ABT veteran, a 22-year-old Bolshoi sensation and an established star of the Mariinsky Ballet.

Turns out that AJ Taudevin, who wrote Chalk Farm with Kieran Hurley, and Julia Taudevin, who appears in the 55-minute play with Thomas Dennis, are the same person.  That's another way of saying that the charged feeling expressed by the mother in the one-act is shared by both author and actor and therefore movingly synergistic.




Now that people are learning new things faster, and recording what they are doing, it challenges others to do something more advanced, in other words, \one-upping\ and that ultimately continues the trend.
There was part of me that didn't want to get involved in the discussion at all because I wanted the news about it to end so that the singer in question could just forget about it and move on.


The film Party Girl, which opened the 'Un Certain Regard' section this year in Cannes, had a very special, personal meaning for me, an extra reason to watch it...
\Art is a lie that makes us realize truth,\ Pablo Picasso told an interviewer in 1923, but artists also need to adhere to a less lofty form of truthfulness.
For me, there is always a film within a festival that defies all expectations. Of course, to even choose a film from a catalogue of hundreds, it has to be on my radar for a few reasons (some truly mundane) which include favorite actor or actress, filmmaker, writer or producer.

In George Bernard Shaw's The Philanderer, directed by Elaine Herman for the Long Beach Playhouse Mainstage Theatre, Leonard Charteris (Andy Gerges) is a cad that masquerades as a progressive lover.

Cannes was full of unusual discussions and strange happenings.

Two new films shown at CAAMFest 2014 examine what happens when the bubble of supposed perfection bursts and people must struggle to save face while scrambling to hide their emotional scars. Not surprisingly, in both films technology plays a key part in ruining people's innocence.

US-China relations have their ups and downs but the Philadelphia Orchestra is about to continue their series of musical cultural exchange with China.

A lot of what gets praised as great street photography these days has to do with juxtaposition, forced perspective or some bizarre subject matter. For sure, those images deserve their due. However, I tend to favor photos that have great light and composition, and where the subject is a little more sublime.
How can an exhibit in Brooklyn about the civil rights movement not include the history of the Young Lords, and the Puerto Rican political movement and the artists it inspired throughout the '60s and beyond?

Sometimes, too much coaching is more detrimental than helpful. At some point, take the training wheels off and fly solo.
Bartlett occupies another place in the pantheon of modernism to the extent that she refuses such categorization. There's something almost homespun about Bartlett's brand of abstraction. At times her paintings exude the feeling of Americana, of folk art.
A few weeks ago, I wasn't feeling so great. My allergies were bothering me and I was tired, as I often am this time of year. Then I went to the theater. Miraculously I felt better during Act One.
Crossword puzzles, word scrambles and other \brain games\ are popular choices for people trying to preserve their memory. Yet, recent research shows these activities are not challenging enough.

For the last few years, eight of the nation's lowest performing schools selected, have embraced the arts and art integration -- teaching other disciplines through the arts -- and the results have been extremely encouraging.
Perfection is so overrated and boring. Call me twisted but during my quarter century in theatre, I loved it when things went wrong.
Often I am surprised with something right as the nominations come out, but, upon reflection, my surprise changes to understanding. This year that wasn't so. My opinions haven't changed since the announcements.
Welcome back to another review of an art show! I traveled south to Gallery 1988 West to view the 30th Anniversary of Ghostbusters traveling art show. The first leg was in New York and I was very lucky that it came to L.A.

In a country where the government controlled the media, his ability to reach listeners was stunted. Nevertheless, he has continued to write and occasionally perform and release albums.
For whatever reason, Italy offered few potential students, as few ambitious and gifted young Italians dedicated themselves to artistic careers in the 1950s and '60s. As a result Fontana, like Giorgio Morandi, appears today as a relatively isolated master rather than as a leader of an important movement.
Broadway By The Year is firing on all cylinders as it celebrates 100 years of musical theater with its biggest series yet.
Without a clear picture of the art and other programs that will be mounted in the future, the organization cannot achieve its mission, cannot build an audience or donor base and, frankly, is of little value. Arts organizations, after all, exist to produce art.
Walking up the stairs of the Theatre Croisette inside the JW Marriott after the screening, I felt as if I was thankfully coming up for air, after having been submersed in feelings and beautifully cinematic anguish for nearly two hours.

Muller felt the emotion in his work even in a newspaper image he spotted in the mid-eighties, after which he spent a long time seeking Stock out. He then commissioned Stock to create a painting inspired by an earlier book of Conrad's.

The mind works in mysterious ways. During one week I had some bizarre experiences in dreamland that covered sights and sounds quite different from past adventures.


The festival kicked off perfectly for me inside the Palais on Wednesday morning, to watch the first Cannes screening of Olivier Dahan's Grace of Monaco, starring Nicole Kidman. I expected entertainment from the film and instead, got a lesson in what it means to be a woman, a strong woman.
I want to capture something real. Something that quenches my thirst for authenticity. Big words for something that is just a simple personal emotion, that if you are lucky, is shared by others as well.
Saeculum Obscurum, Latin for \The Dark Ages,\ was coined by Caesar Baronius in 1602 to describe the cultural decline of the Roman Empire between the 5th and 15th century in Western Europe.
War is in the air again. Be it in Ukraine, surrounded by the second largest stash of nuclear weapons on earth outside the U.S., or among the legions of child soldiers in Somalia, Congo and Sudan, or with bad luck, back on the Indochinese peninsula up to Bangladesh.

Charitably yours attended the kick-off cocktail for the Southampton Animal Shelter Foundation \Pit Bulls as Pets\ encouraging rescue and adoption of these sweet canines.

Over the past seven years, I've been allowed to observe and document the process of conceiving, curating, building, and now opening to the public the National 9/11 Memorial Museum. My images and recordings span seven remarkable years.




If you're looking for reviews, there are brilliant men and women out there who do it all beautifully. But if you're looking for highlights, fun tidbits and a slightly different way of looking at the grandest film festival in the world, you're in the right place.
What Irma La Douce really is is rampant idiocy, for which there may be no excuse but for which there may be a wacky rationale having to do with national tastes.

This week marks the third year of Frieze New York, the London fair that went head-to-head with the tradition of the Armory Show and took NADA and Pulse with it, subsequently asserting itself as a \fair\ contender.

All the great international galleries filled the soundstages and open sets along the corridors and streets within Paramount.










Calling it The Vibrator Play teases you into thinking it's only about sex toys. It's not. Calling it In The Next Room better describes the story's more serious plot line.
Visually, the show was stark and beautiful. Harry Frehner's sets and Marcus Dilliard's lighting effectively suggested the actual settings while also reminding one of the constant prison theme.


\I think people need to be taught how to look at art just like they need to learn to read literature. And the best way by far to ensure that is if a person has had art classes and understands the mind-hand connection that way.\


The established model of presenting new works to audiences is changing and the audiences are changing dramatically too. An entire generation of composers and performers are taking the presentation of their works into their own hands.

The artist Ellie Ga has created works out of her experiences in the North Pole and more recently off the coast of Alexandria, at the site of the underwater excavation of the famous Pharos Lighthouse -- one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.

Sanford Jay Frank, the Emmy Award-winning writer and producer, screenwriting guru and conservative ideologue whom everyone called Sandy, died at his home in Calabasas on April 18.

Mr. Lowry, please allow me to express that, if, based solely on your judgment, you decided to tear down a swath of Manhattan for the sake of progress or for the sake of art, you would have my full confidence for such a decision.
Chris Davies is the President of Fabrik Media, a Los Angeles-based publishing and marketing agency. Concerned by the art fair under-representation of otherwise talented photographers, he founded \Photo Independent
Not a trick question



It's taken for granted that any superior drama depends on its stakes being high. If that's the case, then The Great Immensity -- created by the always-intrepid Civilians troupe and presented at the Public after a world premiere at Kansas City Repertory Theatre -- is indubitably superior drama.


A rarely produced 1980 play by Horton Foote would seem an unlikely subject for an opera, but in the hands of the marvelous Frederica von Stade and the talented composer and librettist team of Ricky Ian Gordon and Leonard Foglia, it becomes a tour de force.
Keeping up appearances sometimes requires extraordinary effort. A lot can be overlooked when someone is young, pretty, perky, and in good health. But when tragic events darken one's days, desperate times require desperate measures.


There must always be something a tiny bit sad when we take ourselves so far back in time to such idealized tunes and harmonies, and then eventually to have to return to our modern noisy world.

There are three ways to look at the work in the new show at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art
