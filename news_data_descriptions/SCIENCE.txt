Much of the opposition to Mars exploration is based on disinformation and distraction tactics that imply or even claim outright that Mars would bust the budget or endanger Social Security, which, given actual budgetary facts and context, is preposterous.



Some editors at the New York Times seem to have either developed a severe case of institutional amnesia, or decided to confer the presumption of innocence upon cellphone radiation, as the newspaper did upon asbestos for an entire decade after the mineral had been shown to be the most important industrial carcinogen in the world.







By the 1920s, America had developed a better system of infrastructure. This meant that vehicles needed to go longer distances. The discovery of large petroleum reserves had reduced the price of gasoline. This made the gasoline car more attractive to consumers.
Most people think that Star Trek-style nuclear rockets are a thing of the future, but the fact is we had them in the 1960s... and gave up on them.
Having just published a book on the origin and synthesis of life, I was fascinated to learn that I'd missed interviewing one of the field's most provocative scientists -- virologist Luis Perez Villarreal -- who takes a \virus-first\ perspective to life.







The results were clear and a bit surprising. Contrary to the commonly held view that experience brings wisdom, older and younger adults in this study were indistinguishable in their wise reasoning--at least about personal conflicts.
Strong northwest winds blew ash and dust from the 1912 eruption of Novarupta over parts of Kodiak Island on Thursday, limiting visibility and prompting some airlines to cancel flights.






I was fortunate enough to be invited to a screening and press conference for the movie Chappie. It is a great movie about a police robot named Chappie that is downloaded with a program that makes him self-aware.
Upon the electronic distribution of a picture of nothing more than a dress, we saw the birth of the stalwart White-and-golders and the die-hard Black-and-bluers.  This dress is a nice example of how what you see isn't necessarily what you perceive.



This unilateral focus on the dark side has had the unintended effect of blinding us to one of the most obvious and inspiring features of the experiment
We take for granted the impact of the physical and biological sciences on our world, forgetting that it once took months to get from the east coast to the west coast or to communicate with someone across the ocean.


The first step to solving problems is to identify and understand them. With that in mind, here is a list of five reasons why some liberals are just as bad, or at least almost, as creationism-believing conservatives when it comes to spreading pseudoscience.

Sports create a relationship between the fan and the players. This relationship resembles that of a family. Sports fans, like other people, separate themselves out into similar groups with common values, religions, aesthetics, ethnicities and so forth.
At tonight's Oscars we'll no doubt see some familiar faces winning that coveted gold statuette. It's no secret that these sparkling little men aren't 100% gold--they're only coated in 24-carat gold--so that makes it harder to figure out how much gold they actually contain. Luckily math comes to the rescue.


Manx--the ancient Celtic tongue spoken on the Isle of Man--had all but vanished by the 1970s. Defying the odds, it has returned to daily use through the heroic efforts of Manx language warriors. I visited the Isle of Man recently to hear the story of Manx's surprising survival.




There are no passengers on Spaceship Earth, only crewmates, and we all have a responsibility to mind the ship and take care of our crew-mates. In fact, when we pull back temporally and look at long-term effects, it becomes apparent that we must collaborate, for the survival of life on Earth.


What if Dr. Townes, instead of taking that timeout, had sent a text or played Angry Birds? Might we be in the dark about the laser? As research and Townes' example suggest, the unpredictable sparks of our own mental machinations should be something we don't want to miss any more than the majestic sight of a passing whale.
On February 14, Hazel and Franklin will meet for a blind date. There is a good chance things will get heavy; it will likely be the first -- and possibly the last -- chance either has for sex in their adult lives. There is also a small chance Franklin will get eaten.
The sun is a stormy star that, across the centuries, has gifted our Earth with some incredible moments of calamity. Telegraph and radio technologies and even satellites and human safety have been placed in the breach of near-destruction. Is there a major \superstorm\ in our future?

The tragic shooting of three young university students at UNC Chapel Hill yesterday could have been adopted by the media as yet another indictment of the rampant gun culture in the United States.




The microscope is one of the quintessential symbols of science, invoking images of researchers in white lab coats. Microscopes have been saving lives for decades by helping diagnose any number of deadly diseases, but in many parts of the world, they are in short supply.

Navigation requires a reference frame.  We need reference frames to tell us where we are with respect to other objects and we need reference frames to tell us how we are oriented with respect to other objects.  There is no single universal frame that is used for all operations.





Vaccines are a great triumph of the human intellect over ancient evils. That triumph must not be dimmed by ignorance, paranoia, and demagoguery.
New data from the Planck satellite indicates that the cosmic microwave background pattern once thought to be from gravitational waves is an artifact of galactic dust.


NASA's first mission of 2015 is underway, successfully launching a Delta II rocket equipped with a soil moisture mapping satellite at 9:22 a.m. EST Saturday from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the Central Coast of California.
Tife Odumosu didn't sit down and immediately draw the perfect cartoon. He started drawing and iterated into his more finalized sketch. Some strokes of his pencil improved his work and others did not. Is this failure? I don't think so.
Astronomers have been waiting for this for a long time, and at some time in the not so distant future the brilliant red star in the constellation Orion will explode. What will it look like?




Railroading people inappropriately into psychiatric hospitals is a slippery slope that can lead to grave violation of human rights and a distortion of our most precious constitutional protections.

Unless you are Rip van Winkle, you are well aware that the footballs in the game in New England were underinflated. There is talk that the weather is to blame. If you run the numbers, here's what the equation looks like.







By measuring very precisely the motion of the Andromeda galaxy relative to the Milky Way, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were able to determine in 2012 that the Milky Way and Andromeda are destined for a head-on collision in about 4 billion years.
Does self-discipline today really pay off later in life -- in jobs, paychecks, promotions and bonuses, professional prestige and wealth? Surprisingly, given the importance of employment to well-being and the global economy, the link between self-control and job success has not been thoroughly studied. Until now.

SESAME stands for Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East and will be a world-class particle-accelerator-based facility for applied research that covers the full spectrum from protein crystallography to understand the structure of viruses to solid-state physics to improve our computers.
Academic research institutions are undeniably under duress. While some of it may be due to overbuilding research infrastructure during the years of doubling the National Institutes of Health budget, they are now dealing with a new normal of having to do more with less.
We all know that exercise is good for us. And this past holiday season, the market was awash with activity monitors like the FitBit and Nike Fuel Band to help you reach your fitness goals from the neck down. But what about from the neck up?

It's been many years since I have trusted anything I read in a medical or psychiatric journal. There is an enterprise wide positive bias; findings never seem to replicate; benefits are hyped; harms are hidden.


Science fiction sometimes barely beats out science fact as technological advancements rapidly transform the world.  But the changes that are anticipated aren't always the ones that arrive. Here's a look back at what the polls tell us the public has expected from scientific progress -- and how often they've been disappointed.


Lots of elective surgery is probably unnecessary, and back operations are the most notorious example.









A recent Hubble image of the galaxy IC 335 shows it to be a star-filled galaxy with a flat shape not unlike our own Milky Way. But whereas the Milky Way contains vast collections of nebulae and dust clouds, IC 335 seems to have none. A look behind the curtain gives us clues to how two similar galaxies like IC 335 and the Milky Way could turn out so differently.







We asked 11-year-olds to come up with their own questions to pose to scientists. This year, kids have asked scientists What is Sleep? It's probably a question we all have asked ourselves from time to time. We spend a third of our lives doing it, but we don't fully understand why.




Alan Turing and his legacy are pivotal reminders of the limitations of data analysis without the context. How would he be evaluated today looking only at some of those metrics? He published just a few articles in his too short life, but Turing's work has had profound impact upon computer science that still resonates.


I agree that it is crucial to attend to the psychological and emotional meaning of all experiences and understand the social context in which they occur. But I do worry that the report creates its own set of unintended problems and may inadvertently perpetuate rather than dispel confusion and stigma, especially for those who have the most severely impairing of psychotic experiences.


Since Christmas is approaching, I'm tempted to say that these books might make good stocking stuffers. But the male ego is so fragile that some delicacy is required on the part of the giver, who must somehow insinuate that she's just trying to improve an already awesome performance.

Fifty years ago, in 1964, physicists Murray Gell-Mann at Caltech and George Zweig at CERN came up with the idea of the quark as a response to the bewildering number of elementary particles that were being discovered at the huge \atom smasher\ labs sprouting up all over the world.
In the midst of a series of technical glitches that delayed the planned launch of the Orion capsule by a Delta IV rocket on Thursday, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden is reported to have told NBC News, \We're now on the way to Mars, and that's what's most important.\ Uh, no.
Obstacles to this basic need to roam, such as human development, can provide formidable threats to long-term survival of many species. For the large carnivores, it's not just about losing the freedom to move, it's about losing a natural process.
The brutal flip side of this reductionist idea is the implication that if you're not at the five sigma level, your efforts, while admirable and even useful, will never be fodder for future memory or future textbooks -- that most of us are no more than worker bees.

As it stands now, the expert testimony in many trials is pretty worthless. Each side presents an extreme set of opinions that in opposite ways distort the complex reality. The jury cancels them out or makes a pretty blind choice between them.


Unlocking the secrets of the placenta is no small undertaking, but the potential benefits are tremendous--for science and for health.
Millions of doses will be needed, and not just to help end the current epidemic but also, crucially, as a stockpile to prevent future outbreaks from getting out of control.
Do giant black holes exist? Can they warp time and space? Is time travel possible? To reality check the science of Interstellar, I spoke with theoretical physicist Brian Greene.
We must get back to treating the whole person, not just his brain circuits. The brain is involved in all we do and what we are, but it is also itself influenced by our psychology and social context.
Skeptical Science is a great website that debunks global warming deniers. But their home page has a box counting up the amount of energy trapped by greenhouse gases in units of Hiroshima atomic bomb energy.


On 12 November 2014, China and the U.S. reached a historic agreement to limit greenhouse gases. Other nations will hopefully follow suit. But even these cuts may not be enough. So how are we going to meet these goals?



About 450 light-years from Earth, in the constellation Taurus, a dense, dark, interstellar cloud has slowly started to reveal its secrets. The addition of new high-resolution data like that for the star HL Tau is at long last allowing astronomers to see the hidden details of planet and disk formation and, from this, create the next-generation  physics-based models for how planets form.
Finding a human mate is difficult enough. We at least, however, have bars and online dating sites. For the octopus, things can be a little more challenging.



DNA testing can sometimes provide truly miraculous results for adoptees wishing to pursue information about their birthparents.







A new particle accelerator design that uses a chamber filled with a hot plasma of lithium gas could form the basis of smaller, more powerful atom-smashers than the Large Hadron Collider.
In my work as a conservation biologist, I often find myself as the only woman at the table. Despite the many advances of women in the boardroom and on the corporate payroll, the world of conservation brokers remains male-dominated. Why not engage the other 51 percent of the population?

Because of inadequate treatment and housing, the mentally ill are extremely vulnerable to arrest for avoidable nuisance crimes -- it is as simple as stealing some food from a store, sleeping on a bench in a public park, or shouting back at voices in the middle of the night.



In part, the lack of research in \non-profitable\ infectious diseases occurring in underprivileged countries has left threats like Ebola largely unaddressed. In addition, inequalities within the system of international scientific collaboration have hindered African researchers from leading the way against diseases ravaging their continent.


I simultaneously felt awe, fear, excitement, humility, cowardice, courage, frailty, strength, embarrassment, curiosity, sorrow, and joy.
The left-right reversal in this sense always happens in mirroring the object for which left and right can be defined, irrespective of the relative configuration of the object to the mirror. The reason can be explained as follows.
Usually, when a launch goes wrong just a few seconds after liftoff, the problem has something to do with an engine. Perhaps a fuel leak or a clogged fuel line.








Listening the other day to BBC Radio 4, I caught the end of one The Philosopher's Arms. The subject was trolley ethics. My hope was that a big problem with the best-known example of this philosophical discipline would be explored. Sadly, though, it was left undiscussed.
The increasing irregularity of monsoons affects lives around the world. We do not know how climate change will affect monsoon behavior, but the best scientific hypotheses are that we may never return to a steady, dependable monsoon. Climate change may fatally break the ancient relationship between farmer and monsoon.
Truth be told, I don't spend a whole lot of time on Tumblr, but there are a few masterpieces that are worth keeping an eye on. One of my favorites is Mara Grunbaum's WTF Evolution?, which takes a regular look at some of evolution's strangest and most perplexing creations. Now, in plenty of time for Xmas, Gunbaum's evolutionary freak show is a book.




Remarkably, people with Down syndrome have an increased incidence of leukemia but a much lower incidence of solid tissue tumors. What is it about the extra copy of chromosome 21 that protects them from solid tumors but predisposes them to blood cancers?
Smile, don't slouch, and don't cross your arms. Your parents probably taught you to use certain body language to appear friendly and polite. But new research shows that your body language does much more than just change the way other people see you -- it can even change how you see yourself. Psychologists describe this phenomenon as \embodied cognition.\\n\nJust watch the latest video in our Talk Nerdy series above to learn more.
I have been an avid science fiction reader all my life, but as an astronomer for over half my life, the essential paradox of my fantasy world can no longer be maintained. Basically, science tells us that traveling fast enough to make interstellar travel possible requires more money than society will ever be able to invest in the attempt.

There is no such thing as power to spare in our world today, yet overconsumption continues, despite warnings and encouragement to cut down on electricity usage.
Many people have a need to be remembered well, even if that motivation is hidden, so sparking it can shift the focus to future others. Public policies that encourage futuristic contemplation might be one tool for stemming the ravages of climate change before it's too late.


My problem is high places, and the Greek myth of Icarus never made much sense to me. I've never seen it as much of a cautionary tale. It's more like a story of the obvious.








The fundamental ethos of natural selection dictates that species optimally adapt to a given environment over time. If the environment during a given time is unlike the environment that the species adapted to, the species is considered mismatched, in that its traits are no longer optimal for that environment.



The stem-cell disgrace of Korean cloning fraudster Hwang Woo-suk has now inspired a movie. Whistle Blower opened in Korea this week. Names have been changed, and it's presented as fiction, but no one is even pretending it's not about the scientific \scandal of the century\ that unfolded between 2004 and 2006.
When the Moon is totally in the Earth's shadow, called totality, the Moon will turn an eerie shade of red as sunlight bends through the Earth's atmosphere to reach it.  After totality, the Earth's shadow will slowly wipe off the Moon and return it to its normal, full self.

If it was possible, then the extension of \the internet of things\ to \the internet of biology\ e.g., bacteria, molds, plants and crops should also be possible -- in fact all living things could be networked and online.



Intriguingly, people don't lie and cheat indiscriminately -- simply because they can get away with it. Even when there is no chance of being found out, people show some level of aversion to acting unethically. They want it both ways
Ignorance, false claims to expertise and scientific illiteracy are threatening our children's health.








Learning about the science of climate change may be uncomfortable for some visitors to the Perot Museum. But sometimes reality is uncomfortable -- and visitors to the museum need to see that.
Less than 1 percent of the Ph.D.s in fields related to human genetic research go to Native Americans, and they make up less than one fifth of 1 percent of the members of the American Society of Human Genetics. This is particularly troubling in light of a history of exploitative genetics research with Native American communities.

Puberty suppression for gender-dysphoric adolescents has only been around since the late 1990s. The Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria at Amsterdam's VU University pioneered this approach, and their recent online publication of a longitudinal study in the journal Pediatrics offers insights into how some of these kids fare.


Canadian researchers found that during ovulation the female genitalia is more responsive to images of penetration than to images of oral sex. The difference is significantly reduced during non-fertile phases of the menstrual cycle.

According to some calculations, there's a 16 percent chance that a significant CME will hit the earth dead center in the next decade.  You might want to tell your power company to think about hurrying up with that surge protector and shunt.
It sounds like some exotic story that you would find in a National Geographic magazine, but it's actually a story that many physicists are increasingly worried about!
George Church -- professor at Harvard and MIT, multifaceted researcher, entrepreneur, author and advocate of open-access genomics -- gives good quotation. The latest publication to exploit this is The Economist, which just ran a feature about him called \Welcome to my genome,\ which includes some of Church's predictions for human genetic modification.
Stonehenge was surrounded by a complex of smaller henges and pit-like monuments that appear to have astronomical significance, according to new 3D-scanned maps of the area around the ancient stone circle.


For many years, I have been anticipating the start of a revolution in the satellite market, in which the majority of the satellites built and launched would be of the micro, nano, pico, and femto variety.
















The mental health industry works very hard to convince government to throw money at \mental health\ problems that are very broadly and loosely defined, instead of having a clear focus on delivering basic services to the seriously ill.







If the type of telescope described here can be built, then the tyranny of distance is vanquished. You can forget deep space probes and their long travel times. We could explore alien worlds in the comfort of our own homes, as our laptops scroll and zoom through data sets collected by a mammoth, space-based telescope array.
An ambitious campaign by the space fundraising group Uwingu starts today that will allow participants to beam a message to Mars.


Until astronomers detect signs of life on Earth-like plants around Sun-like stars, or until SETI searches record an old TV show broadcast by a civilization circling another star, we will have to be satisfied with these tiny, fluffy space aliens.
I realized how easily we immerse ourselves in our own disciplines and envelop ourselves in our own values, and that exiting these self-imposed and limiting confines is key to understanding and propelling ourselves toward any future -- especially the one we humans envision on Mars.

We should not be reluctant to embrace the one word that has always encompassed everything that we do






In April I asked a group of sixth graders from Beaufort Middle School in North Carolina, \Do I look like a scientist to you?\ A young boy sitting in the corner of the room loudly answered, \Uh, yeah. Why not?\
Luckily, the two Americans who received ZMapp, the new experimental drug for Ebola, seem to be improving, which holds great promise and hope for thousands of other people but also raises broader ethical issues and questions.


University of California, Berkeley, physicists have, for the first time, showed that, in fact, it's possible to follow the metaphorical cat through the whole process, whether he lives or dies in the end.
Let's take a look at one of the most intriguing of the 1,739 confirmed exoplanets that is both Earth-sized and in the habitable zone of its star. Known only by its catalog number, Kepler-186f, it has no name yet, but we know quite a bit about it already.
Vocal communication of whales sounds like songs whales sing to each other. So if our algorithm was able to analyze songs made by whales, we started to wonder how well it could analyze songs made by humans. It just made sense to give it a try.
Following are excerpts from my interviews on the origin of life at hydrothermal springs with Michael Russell and Elbert Branscomb, peppered with comments from Nick Lane.
As an experimental particle physicist working at the Large Hadron Collider, learning to handle large amounts of data is a necessary skill. In addition, one needs to learn how to differentiate between something that is useful and something that is not.


Life on Mars is inevitable.  Now, such a statement may sound audacious, farfetched, and maybe even just a little bit crazy. It might be viewed as being just a wild prognostication about finding extraterrestrial microbial life on Mars - but it is based firmly in the realm of reality.
A recent study suggests that cinnamon may be good for a lot more than sticky buns. For the first time, the dietary addition of cinnamon powder has been shown to be effective at slowing or even halting the progression of a neurodegenerative disease.


At times there are certain problems with published research results. One could be forgiven for drawing the conclusion that there is something rotten in the research enterprise.









A new study released July 31 by the National Research Council may help prevent future accidents by challenging current safety standards in academic and nonindustrial labs across the U.S. with nine recommendations aimed at the higher-education and scientific community.
You've got to wonder what would motivate creatures from other worlds to suffer a journey of hundreds of trillions of miles to visit our planet? Why bother? I've been asked this question at least a half-dozen times by Hollywood writers, and the best answer I can muster is \I don't know.\



If you use your intuition, believe what others tell you on first blush, or simply try to calculate your way to conclusions, probably not. If you view the world empirically, watching as numerous observations and experiments put together conclusions, then yes, you see the world as a scientist.

Hollywood blockbusters are not science documentaries nor do they pretend to be, they are pure entertainment that recognizes the interest and fascination people have with nature, natural disasters, and the Earth.


Our main findings -- that women trainees were disproportionately targeted for abuse, and that targets generally felt they had few avenues to report or resolve these problems -- suggest that at least some science field sites are neither safe nor inclusive.


In April 2014, C. Randal Mills was named President and CEO of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, a San Francisco-based agency created in 2004 to allocate over $3 billion in funding for stem cell research for California. I recently caught up with Randy to discuss his new role at CIRM and the road ahead.





We all spend a lot of time waiting in lines -- way more than we'd like. But what if we're waiting for something new and exciting? Doesn't waiting for new purchases become a positive experience, where we actually savor the anticipation so much that it trumps our impatience? Well, yes and no.

Upon approach, offshore oil and gas platforms appear industrial and lifeless -- devoid of any life, besides the humming of industry. Their potential to function as artificial reef systems seems impossible. Yet we have found that offshore oil and gas platforms provide one of the most unique artificial ecosystems in California.






Scientists captured the first microscopic images of photosynthesis in action, showing a clump of proteins called photosystem II splitting water molecules into electrons, protons, and oxygen.

The first outbreak of Ebola was in 1976 -- nearly 40 years ago -- so why is there yet no cure?



As the morbid and jaded creatures we are, humans really get a kick out of pondering our species' ultimate demise. It's time we give some love to more obscure, but still scientifically plausible means of extinction.
Scientists around the world are campaigning in favor of sensible regulation of stem-cell therapies. The recent conference of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) opened with a panel discussion about how to sort the real from the bogus treatments.







I first met Jack Szostak at the Simons Foundation this spring, and then again at the World Science Festival, where he announced he'd have \life in the lab\ in three to five years.  Our conversation follows.
About 13.8 billion years ago, the hydrogen in my body emerged from the Big Bang. It spent eons just hanging around in the rapidly expanding and cooling universe. As stars became supernovae, the other elements in my body were forged and ejected into space.



Research published today by the American Psychological Association has shown that chimpanzees prefer listening to West African akan and North Indian raga over listening to silence. What does this say about the evolutionary purpose of music?
Built into this pipeline metaphor is the assumption that the pipeline lays flat and that the momentum of every individual going through is unchanged. The data tell a different story.

At an international conference in Mexico a few years ago, Richard Dawkins, having expounded at length on how sexual natural selection explains life on Earth without any need for a \creator,\ went on to say, \And I am sure that something like the principle of natural selection operates in the physical universe as well.\ Sounds totally silly? Well, there's more to it
New research published this month shows that -- justifiably or not -- people who played a varsity high school sport are expected to be more self-confident, have more self-respect, and demonstrate more leadership than people who were part of other extracurriculars.




Intelligence, like pretty much everything else subjective, is on a spectrum. And just because you may be lower than average in one or every single area, doesn't have anything to do with how good you will be at your job whether that's a scientist, clinician or business woman.
Scientists harness the power of thousands of computer processors simultaneously to better understand how the HIV virus interacts with the cells it infects, to discover or design new drugs that can attack the virus at its weak spots and even to use genetic information about the exact variants of the virus to develop patient-specific treatments.

I love insects, which is probably why I became a scientist, focusing on these extraordinary critters and their relationships with plants in the forest canopy. But insects also love me -- and a recent research trip to Ethiopia proved no exception.
Calling all techno-archaeologists


The 12-hour Babylonian solar day persisted into our era because it was embedded in culture too,  especially where the culture was agrarian. The deficiencies of Berossas' clock, so evident to us, may have escaped its users. I find a hint of this in a 1909 travel book, High Albania, by the intrepid Edith Durham.
Protocell pioneer Matthew Powner has the fresh-faced good looks of an athlete you'd expect to show up at World Cup 2014, and a voice somewhat reminiscent of the \British Invasion.\ But the relaxed focus he projects signals something profoundly more urgent
Much of the research into nicotinic compounds comes from Big Tobacco, the makers and marketers of one of the most addictive substances on the planet and the single most preventable cause of death. Researchers even believe that understanding nicotine may lead one day to an effective \cure\ for smoking.
So if happiness is as important a goal in life as American culture makes it seem, we need to understand how age affects it. Only then can we know how to better treat our families, communities, and citizens of all ages.



What were all the boys who were running away from girls like me running toward, you might ask? Their glorious futures, of course. If boys wanted to fly, they had plenty of assistance.





Many science fiction writers have rather accurately predicted future technologies, including the rise of the Internet and the demise of quality television. In doing so, they have given us language and ideas that have shaped the digital age in which we live.


TIGHAR is planning a search of the coral reef face at Nikumaroro Atoll in the central Pacific, where its researchers think Earhart's airplane wound up after it went missing on July 2, 1937.
I met three impressive Mars One women last weekend
As Nicholas Wade's new book demonstrates, the category error that confuses human genetic variation with socially constructed race remains all too common.






In his new book, The Beginning and the End



The Division of Particles and Fields in the American Physical Society started a community planning exercise in 2013 to help plan the next 10 years of particle physics investments in light of the Higgs discovery, new information about neutrinos, and new information about dark energy and the accelerating universe.

In his response to comments by me, Jon Marks and Jennifer Raff, Wade does not take on any substantive aspect of the debate; rather, he misrepresents the science again and takes a shot at our credentials as scholars. Here is a very quick response to his comments, in hopes of correcting the record and getting this debate back to the science.




Wade can't justify his first and primary point
The scientist who personifies the greatest achievements of Greek and Western science was Archimedes. He applied mathematics for the understanding of the natural world and the cosmos.



Unfortunately, CBT is not readily available to everyone who might benefit from the therapy. It's rarely used in settings where addicts are typically treated, in large part because there are not enough well-trained therapists to meet the need.
What is it that makes two minds respond so differently to the same encounter with misfortune?
Much of modern physics has been about exploring inherently invisible things, which seem to be far more common than the obvious things we experience with our senses. Yet these invisible things follow rigorous laws that allow us to test their existence in many ways. Here is a very short list of some of the \invisible\ things that we routinely work with.






Why do we care when we see the Nigerian schoolgirls who are the prisoners of Boko Haram? We do watch. Most of us don't change the channel. Why?
Not all papers published in a particular journal, whatever its impact factor may be, will have the same impact




One sign we're on our way not just to visit, but to colonize, Mars is that people are talking about what sort of governance the first settlers will implement and adhere to.
Treating babies with stimulants is based on no research, is reckless, and takes no account of the possible harmful long-term effects of bathing baby brains with powerful neurotransmitter drugs.








Denis Noble's understanding of music is clearly reflected in the elegance with which he communicates science.  Maybe that's partly why he was invited to China to talk about evolution and the need to move beyond neo-Darwinism. (Noble prefers the term \modern synthesis.\)
When Hina Chaudhry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine heard that women in the last few months of pregnancy have the highest rate of recovery from heart failure, she wondered whether it might be the fetal cardiomyocytes that are doing the repair. Chaudhry has confirmed her suspicions.
Two winners of the International Poker Tournament, in different years, sought my advice on calling bluffs, knowing that I am an expert in spotting liars. I told them I had not played poker since junior high and had never watched poker being played. They thought that didn't matter. It turned out they were wrong.





Bouncing balls of light after a lightning storm have been reported for centuries, but only since about the 1960s have scientists started to carefully study them and discover that not only are they real and not fictions of folklore, but they are very hard to understand.





Opening up your life to a camera crew is intrusive, but I did so for Particle Fever, a documentary about particle physics, because I am determined to see one major myth broken

With more than 13 million \likes,\ I F---ing Love Science is the big winner among Facebook pages devoted to science and science communicators. And it would probably be very popular even without the \F\ bomb.  Or would it?


Despite all the debate you often hear about global warming, the basic scientific case is so simple that it can be reduced to a three-step deductive argument.


There will soon be a tipping point when parental common sense, sobering research findings, and media exposure will overwhelm the marketing and political might of the unscrupulous drug companies and the careless prescribing habits of physicians.

Egged on by well meaning (and not so well meaning) experts and by greedy drug companies, we are fast approaching this dystopic wonderland of universal childhood mental illness.
Wives still report doing about twice as much housework and childcare as their husbands. One difference is that today's couples, even if they unconsciously embrace traditional gender stereotypes and live less-than-egalitarian lives, may publicly proclaim more egalitarian values.
\Here is a black hole,\ Ellen says in the video. \You can all see it, right? Wrong, you can't. They're invisible. No one
