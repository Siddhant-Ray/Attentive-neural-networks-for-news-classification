We look forward to his on-air response, and hope that Dr. Oz will be transparent and honest about his methods, intentions and future behavior.




The Hippocratic Oath is an oath historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. It requires a new physician to swear, upon a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards.

In the early days of the American Republic, news media, meaning newspapers and pamphlets, proliferated. They were highly partisan, often nasty, and not necessarily wedded to the truth.
Airlines have taken a fundamentally different approach to the market. Rather than continue to battle one another to the bottom with discount pricing, the industry is now widely practicing what's called \capacity discipline.\ They have effectively curbed supply in order to fuel demand, and it's working. But how doesthis relate to the publishing industry?



Don't look to this first wave of wearables for much that changes how journalists do their jobs gathering news. Coming next, however, are things such as a wrist-launched personal drone and jersey-mounted sports cameras that could open up whole new editorial approaches.
Besides the fact that it is about time a woman took the helm at one of these Sunday morning shows that are hosted by men (women are more than 50% of the population!!), CBS has the perfect person right in front their eyes to take over at Face the Nation!  Norah O'Donnell!




Be understanding and compassionate -- your people are in pain and they will criticize you, question you, berate you, and perhaps even revile you. Forgive them. Love them and care for them - they need good care and feeding on their arduous journey.




Judith Miller recently popped out of the Fox News bubble for a quick jaunt to the Wall Street Journal editorial page, the home base for John Bolton, Max Boot, and other neo-con hawks, to give her forthcoming book a little free advertising. In the process she attempts to whitewash her role as an influential pro-war voice in the lead-up to the Iraq War.













He was always \Jack\ - never Jacob, his given name - and his byline at news organizations that he worked at for nearly seven decades all around the world was always \Jack Freeman.\
So I'm chatting with Freddie Wong, producer of the wildly popular online series Video Game High School, whose company Rocket Jump is launching a new series this year with Hulu and Lionsgate.
It's often said in the digital world that \content is king.\ It is clear that in journalism, good stories (even at considerable lengths) still rule, whether in books, newspapers, magazine, web-based publications, podcasts, or on innovative digital narrative platforms.
Is this really 2015 humor? Is this New Yorker humor? Is this even funny?






















The way we access and consume information is evolving. We've got more information than we know what to do with. No longer are we limited to an hour of nightly news or the black and white pages of your local paper.





It is irrelevant how many times Trinidad James repeats the \N\ word in \All Gold Everything.\  This is a societal issue that needs to be faced head-on, not by playing a media game of hide and seek.


Foreign cultures go back centuries, evident not only from ancient castles on hilltops but from the attitudes inculcated in populations by tradition, attitudes toward family, friends, classmates, local leaders and central governments. A foreign correspondent is always an outsider, but often a welcome onlooker.






Is it inevitable that TV stations suffer the same fate as their print counterparts? Will they too slash newsroom staffs, rely more and more on syndicated, national content and let advertisers encroach on editorial?
When you go public with your opinions, you are apt at times to ruffle some feathers, intentionally or otherwise. I have dealt with this -- on television, on Twitter, and elsewhere -- many times. I have some suggestions for how best to dodge these bullets should you ever find yourself in similar crosshairs.
Everyone who contributes to Facebook or Instagram or Youtube or Twitter -- anyone who contributes content to the vast and ever growing sprawl of the information media matrix is a journalist.  Today, we are ALL journalists -- and that is no bad thing.
Iman Crosson, A.K.A. Alphacat, is known for his impeccable impression of President Obama and went Huge on the Tube (#HOTT) with his Momentous Day rap.

His biggest problem is he appeared to believe the larger-than-life visions of himself that NBC used to promote his broadcasts. He believed his own press, so to speak, and his public persona went straight to his head. Was that why his memory became so foggy?
I have a feeling that Jon Stewart, with his ersatz Ph.D. from Comedy Central (and no student debt), might like to get on the field of real news and journalism, at least the televised kind, and do something to solve those problems, both the country's and the conflictinator's.

When a ship is about to leave port the boatswain's mate and the deck crew hoist the anchor and this is where the phrase \anchors aweigh,\ originates. The anchor is aweigh when it is pulled from the bottom of the harbor and the captain duly notes in his log book that it is \aweigh\ and the ship is leaving port.

I don't know about you, but I'm really feeling sorry for NBC's Brian Williams. If you are a serious news addict, and consequently crave history, you should know that Brian Williams and his ilk are, in the traditional sense, actors rather than scribes.


So has Bill lied? Absolutely. Has he admitted it. Not to me. At least Brian Williams had enough balls to admit he lied. O'Reilly is just a hack.

Recently during a relatively innocuous interview, Geraldo Rivera departed from a line of questioning about his politics and recent experiences shooting a television show to say, \Hip-hop has done more damage to Black and Brown people than racism in the last 10 years.\

As the West ramped up its \War on Terror\, the media portrayed the battle as us versus them. \Us\ being the good Anglo-Saxon Americans and \them\ being the freedom hating fundamentalist Islamists of the Middle East.

Anchors have become the brand, readers, for stories that other producers and reporters uncover. The problem with Brian Williams is that he is a storyteller. The ability to tell a story is very important in every reporter and writer's life. But, Williams did not have the background in reporting and writing to temper his tall tales.


You have landed in a huge, messy puddle of your own making.  You are a champion of independent, fair, reliable journalism at its best in a moment in our country's history when that tradition, which you and I both love and support, is wobbling.
After nearly 16 years, comedian Jon Stewart is leaving the reins of The Daily Show. Recently, a number of comic hosts have left long-term late-night gigs, but barely a blip on the giggle continuity screen. I mean, Stewart's departure is not like Walter Cronkite signing off. On second thought, it's exactly the same.

Saturday's smaller replay in Copenhagen of Paris' Charlie Hebdo massacre that left three dead (including the suspected shooter) and several injured begs the question





Perhaps its time for a psychological intervention, a coming out of the shadows for all of us. Perhaps we could all hold up placards that read \Je suis Brian Williams--I am Brian Williams.\ Now that would turn our world upside down; that would be a revolution I could sign up for.
With the exception of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, enacted in 1998, just one year before Napster and the beginning of online piracy, many of today's copyright laws and regulations date back to 1976.

If you're lucky in life, once in a blue moon, you have a brush with genius like this, someone astoundingly accomplished in their chosen endeavor, who can also give you a takeaway container of wisdom on all, and sundry that can last a lifetime.
Geist is not your father's sidekick, for unlike Ed McMahon, it's abundantly clear that this current gig is just a stop on the way to a much larger role that Geist gets closer to with each broadcast.








The mistakes Williams has admitted to, and apologized for, have cast a dark cloud over everyone at NBC News.  The news organization is filled with dedicated, hardworking and accomplished producers, reporters and technicians.  This controversy has been disruptive and discouraging.




Personalization in the magazine industry is not a new idea. I remember someone coming up with it at an offsite meeting in the early 1990s. Why has it taken us all so long?
The most important element of comedy is timing -- and in Israel, comedy and timing can be friends or they can be foes. No matter how funny the election campaign videos are, we live in a serious, disastrous neighborhood, and sometimes the reality calls for seriousness.


What Rodriguez is confronting us with is a raw and very unpleasant image of the Valley that's applauded for creating the world's most progressive companies when, in fact, some women are calling it a place stuck in the 1950s.

The legendary CBS News producer Sanford \Sandy\ Socolow has died.  He worked at CBS News for 32 years, during its truly golden years, four of them as Walter Cronkite's executive producer.  He was a rare combination of outstanding journalist and wonderful person, beloved by all those who knew him.
There have been recurrent racial incidents during these years and wiser heads have managed to step up and bring calmness to the situation.  There are more doors open now to Native Americans than there were 25 years ago and I hope that in honor of Governor Mickelson that his proclamation of reconciliation played into it.








I am an American Muslim. This is my identity, but it's very difficult for me to say it out loud these days. I know it's wrong of me and I constantly get lectured by my other Muslim friends about how I should take pride in my identity and who I am, yet my heart still struggles with it.



It's clear that the slaughter in Paris has managed to change the public policy subject, decisively, away from growing doubts over the wisdom of the endlessly renewable, insanely expensive, surveillance state that much of the non-jihadist world has drifted into since 2001.
A good sound bite packs emotion, opinion, news value and personality, and leaps into a reporter's ear.


We are drowning in \news.\  The proliferation of cable channels coupled with online news is akin to having an enormous hole into which \producers\ need to shovel to fill space. The sheer volume of news sources creates a tsunami of information but does not necessarily leave anyone better \informed\ but simply \aware.\
The New Yorker called my writing dreck. It did not level the slight directly at me but lobbed it wholesale at the self-publishing community of which I'm a member.



In today's Arab world people are cowed, frightened and living under increasing repression. The press is frightened, too. How could it be otherwise in a region where an alliance of governments, private media businesses, and the public has set itself against dissenting voices, portrayed increasingly as a threat to state security?

More than a week after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, American comedians have made it clear that they stand with their fellow satirists in France. There were others who joined the condemnation as well, and not just from comedy.
If we accept that the award winners function -- at least in part -- as indicators of issues society currently has on its collective radar, it's interesting to analyze what they might mean in the context of a broader cultural conversation.
We should strive to reaffirm the most basic principle upon which our societies stand

We must recognize the value that comes from pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable, of breaking taboos, of standing up to thugs. Not to do so speaks to a form of cowardice only supplanted by the news outlets who have refused to show the cartoons and the even more pathetic attempts to justify that decision. It gives those who wish to intimidate us exactly what they want
Some feel that Charlie Hebdo -- by poking fun at and ridiculing cultures, religions and religious figures -- crossed the line, created prejudices, perhaps even incited hatred and violence. This time, I find myself squarely defending Charlie Hebdo's freedom of expression.




I am overwhelmed by the extraordinary variety of writing and publishing platforms available for our consumption today, from the professional journalist and the citizen blogger to the Facebook philosopher and the hashtag activist.




While I praise and appreciate TIME's selection of the \Ebola Fighters\ as their \Person of the Year,\ and although TIME briefly mentions \the promise of U.S. troops to build treatment units,\ this author is at a loss as to why our military men and women were not explicitly included in TIME's Person of the Year.



It seems fitting that as I look back on Moxie Media's year, I'm looking back on five of mine and commemorating the memories alongside The Huffington Post India's very first articles.
RedState, and Moe Lane, would do well to stop using a childish \mock & block\ policy to censor debate on their site. Come join the adult conversation, fellas. You can do it.

The First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States guarantees freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting the press or the rights of individuals to speak freely.



Figueroa's four-part series has ripped the cover off a corrupt branch of the veterans' benefits system, transforming the national conversation about why so many of our soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan are being denied disability benefits and medical care.







For 48 years, Linda Deutsch held a bright candle for The Associated Press. She taught us what true reporting and journalism are truly about.
As long as one grants that the United States' security requires that the state be able to keep some secrets, the question stands

In today's topsy-turvy environment, all bets are off. Rather than focus on critical upcoming legislative elections and a major conference to help attract investments to Egypt's struggling economy, TV channels seem sidelined by matters that raise eyebrows and questions given their timing.
Moore sees the most promising opportunity in digital media around \creative optimization,\ meaning the customization of creative advertising in realtime, as it is consumed. \u00a0While some vendors are making progress in this field, there is much more to be developed. \u00a0He sees this new medium emerging in 2016.

Fifty-one years before the Japanese carrier strike force dropped their deadly bombs on Pearl Harbor, another \Day of Infamy\ that will live forever in the minds of the Lakota (Sioux) people, occurred.
Maybe someone can figure out why the assemblage of \Code Breakers,\ as they're called, are mostly wearing blue? Otherwise, I'm wondering about all the beaming when it comes to the demographics, and the uniformity.
Today, as The Colbert Report airs its final episode, I'm looking back with gratitude on nine years of great television. I loved being on the show several times, discussing everything from my Greek accent to self-sabotage to the obnoxious roommate living in my head. Here are some of my favorite moments on The Colbert Report over the years.

Best Buy was already a part of the Serial world by sheer chance -- they just chose to acknowledge that connection with a tongue in cheek. The only self-interest that the company can be seen to be pursuing here is relevance, which by no means translates directly into profit.






\Today carrying a camera is like carrying a weapon. Who ever might stop you and start interrogating you for taking pictures.\
\The more we immerse ourselves in a virtual representation of reality, the more important signifiers become.\









Sometimes the news is so horrible you just have to laugh at it -- and comics and bloggers help raise awareness of what's wrong in a system that sorely needs changing.










In an increasingly globalized world, albeit with local interests, where stories often break on social media before anyone has time to breathe, journalists and PR pros can't afford to be \geography challenged.\
That's how Serial is supposed to get you
Why is it so tempting to dismiss entire swaths of the media landscape as dying or dead as Farhad Manjoo did in a piece for the New York Times earlier this month? TV is dead, Print is dead, and as Mr. Manjoo suggested, the banner is dead, proclaim technology and media reporters!






I suppose that in the long run the Jesuit priests and nuns truly believed that cornflakes would quiet our sex drive and they eventually found out it did not.
The world of short blogs and 140 characters is symbolic of the all too prevalent overly simplified analyses, and sensational headlines that might generation \likes\ and \retweets,\ but do not bring us to a better understanding of people, communities or our history.

It's a mistake to argue that she's not a credible journalist because she does occasionally express emotion. It's an emotional case which involves real people.




So as we inch closer to our national holiday, I thought sooner rather than later, would be an ideal time to share some historic background and relevant statistics about Thanksgiving should you be searching for such information in the coming days ahead.

Do your best to get it right. If you do, great. If you don't, admit you got it wrong, fix it, even if hard, and try harder next time. And we should reward journalists and press outlets that are practicing good, honest journalism.

The seminar that included participants from Syria, Yemen, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Iraq, Algeria and Turkey ended with an eight-point statement to combat hate speech and promote actions to further ethics, good governance and self-regulation.






The Internet is no longer a luxury for those who can pay or a profitable plaything for a handful of corporations. It is a daily necessity. It is much too precious to be left to the mercies of Internet monopolies. It must be protected by an FCC that governs not only in the public's name but also with its consent.



Too often, news media and social media chatter turn to fear mongering instead of dispassionate reporting of facts. Ebola offered \red meat\ for sensational journalists, talk show hosts and social media opinion leaders.
Trying to get a video to go viral is not a strategy any more than buying lottery tickets is the strategy to build wealth. It's random and unpredictable. Don't bet on it.
There are faculty luncheons and dinners at Harvard throughout the year. It was at one of these functions in 1990 that I first met Ben Bradlee, the esteemed editor of the Washington Post.
The 20th century was the only time in the history of music where some musicians got very well paid for their work. Those days are over. I am not an economist.  One might say a folksinger is opposite of an economist, but I have a reasonable grasp on supply and demand economics.

RT is rapidly transforming itself into an American-style whistle-blower, relentlessly reporting on America's democratic deficiencies and malfeasance, at home and abroad.
Imagine if some media pressure was more equally applied to \forgotten\ health issues. The increased media spotlight could affect the government's approach to funding, research, and communication about prevention -- shifts that could potentially impact thousands of lives annually.





Given the \loaded nature\ of the objects and the situation, there are certainly ways to capture a scene like this that is not only more sensitive (and more mundane), but steers clear of exploitive associations to race and violence.



The relocation of the Navajo should be taught in all public schools and colleges because it was not just the Navajo who suffered the trauma of forced relocation, but hundreds of other Indian tribes suffered the same trauma of relocation.
I'm no Doogie Howser, but isn't this medically certifiable in the real world? If the guy at the corner bar, or at the table next to you, says such nuttiness, don't you move away? I know I do. Weirdo's bother me. Call me old-fashioned. This is Fox News, 2014, stirring the pot. It's what they do.

\It is difficult / to get the news from poems,\ wrote American poet William Carlos Williams, \yet men die miserably every day / for lack / of what is found there.\ And yet, we are seeing more and more efforts to combine poetry and reporting.




Ben Bradlee was undoubtedly the best newsroom leader I ever worked for. He pushed you to be better, spotted the weak spots in your draft and had a nose for news. But I also learned it was not smart to get on his bad side.
If there is any silver lining to conspiratorial thinking, it is a willingness to question what might seem obvious to the linear observer. As a scientist, I always consider such questioning to be positive.

When will there be a good news day? One news day where the news is so good that it is the story of the day. A day that excites all Americans, whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or any other political persuasion. The news is so good that all the news coverage is overwhelmed by this wonderful event.
Most of the rank-and-file conservatives with whom we might interact get their information from conservative media sources. Republican politicians are ensconced within it as well. Inside the walls of that closed environment, facts that do not jibe with conservative ideology or the conservative interpretation of events are twisted, turned on their head, or simply ignored.
A lot of the core institutions of public oversight are being eroded today, the checks and balances going out of whack. This, right now, is the point at which we must either stand up for a strong news media or admit openly that we do not actually care about it as much as we pretend to.
People like Bill O'Reilly call upon people to raise themselves up while helping keep a foot on their necks.
Native Americans have pondered this strange set of circumstances since 1998. In 2009, ten years after the string of circumstantial deaths, Laurette Pourier, a Native American educator, said many Native Americans believe the deaths weren't properly investigated.
Hu's impressive career boosted an increase in Chinese women working in business journalism. After years when business journalism was dominated by men, with the field even called \the forbidden city,\ the number of female business reporters is rising.
Our value as human beings extends far beyond our productive capacity. It includes our capacity to love and be loved, our capacity to listen to others without judgment and with compassion, and our capacity to make a difference for others. We can both contribute value and find value in life at any age.

If the news media's job is to educate, and especially to clarify during times of steep public concerns, then the news media have utterly failed during the Ebola threat. And politically, that translates into a win for Republicans because it means there's fertile ground for their paranoia to grow.


It took years of monitoring and determination, but three media outlets in Sweden pursue gender balance in their reporting, for the benefit of their audience and their own economic success.

Women's magazine Marie Claire announced last July the addition of a new name to its masthead
In film director Hal Ashsby's classic Being There (1979), Peter Sellers plays Chance Gardner, an idiot man-child whose nonsensical comments are mistaken for profundity. Chance, as realized by Sellers, is a classic comic character. Thomas L. Friedman is not trying to be funny.
Almost without exception, today's Internet stars come from outside the Hollywood farm system. They are kids, mostly, who have figured out how to make 140 characters and six-second videos wildly entertaining.
Chips died that winter in 1914. He never had the chance to take Holy Dance to the burial site. Bob said, \That Spring I returned to the spot that Chips told me about where the grave was and sure enough I found it.\
While Maher's points were vastly generalized and his analysis incomplete, there was still some validity to them. In modern America, we are so wed to the ideas of fairness and sensitivity that we can sometimes become blind to the obvious.

We should be able to pay for the form we want it in, including how it is distributed.  I would gladly pay to have a papergirl or boy deliver the paper on the right day in the right way, and I would tip for that privilege.




Facebook now says it will apply greater internal review to research projects, but it misses the ethical point by rejecting external review. With more than one billion users worldwide, the stakes are high for social media users.

Enough. It's not OK to disparage Poland's World War II record. No country fought Nazi Germany longer or sacrificed a larger percentage of its people to Hitler's death machine than Poland. Enough.
Problem is, despite all the bluster and loud sighs, these guys were not actually disagreeing with each other.  Not really.


This Israeli fantasy of making peace with the Arabs without first making peace with the Palestinians has been around for decades. It is, in effect, a desire to turn the Arab Peace Initiative on its head. As is often the case, Netanyahu's clever, but disingenuous, ploys can't stand up in the face of reality.
A few years ago,Bill O' Reilly,host of a highly rated show on Fox News said he didn't think people who opposed the Bush/Cheney Iraq War were traitors,they were just bad Americans. Sean Hannity,another Fox host, had harsh criticism for people who marched in freezing cold weather to oppose this war.




The reporters become less journalists and more movie makers as they try and create a geopolitical drama, in which they have already decided who are the villains and who are the victims.
To my male and female colleagues, I hope you start to lead your teams and businesses with a philosophy I've adopted from someone earlier in my career


Although he has spent many, many words on Singapore, Jim Sleeper doesn't appear to care a fig about the country and its residents. He isn't upset about oppression in Singapore because oppression is bad in and of itself. He's upset about oppression in Singapore because it makes the institution at which he teaches look bad.



Can't the average American understand that it is not an honor to have our culture stolen, mimicked and insulted by fanatical football and baseball fans? We are not, and have never been \Redskins.\

Even knowing all this, after going through a few pages or watching a TV screen while waiting at the doctor's office or in the airport  I can't help  thinking what a crazy world we are in, with people doing all these unbelievable, sometimes unacceptable things. Is that, I wonder, \reality\?





Sometimes the double standards employed by the right-wing Media Research Center are breathtaking in their blatantness.
It seems like the people who are supposed to know what to do, don't. Immanuel Wallerstein, the brilliant world systems scholar says they are stuck because of deeper systemic problems that most of the media misses.
In this clip I asked Gail Sheehy, who interviewed Hillary Clinton many times over the decades, if she thinks the country is now ready for a woman president.
How fast we've moved from peace to war, from hope to despair. Of course, like so many reports about U.S. military action, there was no mention of civilian casualties or other \collateral damage.\
If you get your jollies from watching organizations dig themselves deeper into a brewing crisis, then what's going on right now in the NFL is giving you the biggest endorphin spike of your life.
\If I offended anyone, I apologize, but I'm not sorry for the choice that I made,\ she said.

By exploring the lives and times of the Roosevelts, ER Burns shows that in our not-so-distant past the governing institutions of this country were actually responsive to the needs and desires of working-class Americans.





As a service to the deceased person's families -- often on both sides of the border, some with United States citizenship and some not -- the work is a remarkable study in simple decency and human compassion.



An unprecedented event happened in South Dakota 24 years ago, an event that has not been duplicated by any other state

If had a dime for every time I've heard someone say, \Oh, I don't pay any attention to ads. I don't let them affect me,\ I'd be very rich indeed. Truth be told, ads do affect us -- and often in ways that we never even stop to think about.











There is a colonization connection the indigenous people of Australia and America share.
You chose to venture to the most dangerous places on the planet because sharing the story was worth the risk of your own mortality. You unmasked the evils of our world today and you stared at it straight in the face. And you truly loved doing it.
Amid the media accounts of the worst Ebola outbreak, some significant context is largely missing from the major media reporting. Atop this list are links of the outbreak to the climate crisis and global inequality and austerity-driven cuts in public services that have greatly contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola.
It's just what she does, and despite all the knockdowns she still puts herself out there in a way that leaves her vulnerable. This is so brave it stuns me.





The Media Outlet Crackpot Index measures the potential credibility -- or the lack thereof -- of a given media source. The higher the score, the more likely it is that the story or media outlet is the work of one or more crackpots.

Is my one-time favorite magazine going the way of the dodo bird? What's to become of TIME after it was cut loose from a corporate tether tied to a sought-after prize?




CNN was interviewing someone named Mike Baker who was identified as \a former CIA covert operations officer.\ The interview was about the United States beginning to fly surveillance missions over Syria.

The recent beheading of freelance journalist James Foley (pictured above) by militants from the Islamic State highlights the growing dangers that freelance reporters covering conflict zones face.

After twisting both knobs back and forth for a while, I finally caught a shortwave signal and guess whose voice I heard? Mr Owen Bennett Jones' presenting news hour on the BBC World Service.
The Justice Department's relentless pursuit of James Risen, and its refusal to recognize a qualified, first amendment-based, testimonial privilege for journalists, are serious mistakes. Now would be a good time for President Obama to correct those mistakes.
In a country like Liberia, it matters who fires live rounds. It matters who uses less lethal means to control crowds.  It matters who is present when things go awry.  The reputation of an entire institution is at stake. Because, in Liberia, where mistrust of the government runs deep, incidents can be used to fuel the flame for future violence.
If you take a look at the most successful companies that are purely derivative of the web (as opposed to old companies that have been jammed into the web), you get an interesting (and very valuable) list.




CNN has a freedom project that has been dedicated to fighting modern-day slavery since 2002, and considering the fact that child labour is one dominant form of slavery in this generation, I decided to interview CNN Executive Editor Mr. Leif Coorlim.

Think you have a pretty good idea of what's going on in Ferguson, Missouri? You may not, even if you've been watching a lot of cable news. Especially if you've been watching a lot of cable news. If the media's job is to give viewers and readers an accurate and full idea of what's really going on, we have to acknowledge that there is a long way to go. Of course, Ferguson is not an isolated case. But it is a chance for those of us in the media to expand our understanding of our role in covering the news. At HuffPost we are certainly covering the violence and the underlying racial tensions, but we are also committed to telling the \untold story\ (as our splash put it on Tuesday) -- of compassion, ingenuity, kindness, trust, collaboration and community.



If the early reports are correct and journalist James Foley was, in fact, executed by ISIS, you can honor him -- and not play into the terroristic hands of that organization -- simply by not watching the video of his murder.





I lived in St. Louis for 44 years until I was relocated last year for work. So instead of learning the details of this tragedy from my familiar local news community, I learned from stories by folks who were less familiar with my hometown and there was a difference in the detail.





Newspapers from across the nation and the world found the occupation of Wounded Knee in February 1973 a very hot ticket. Reporters came, they saw, and then they wrote about it.






It is shockingly easy to unintentionally glorify suicide. Williams was a great talent, no doubt, but are we inadvertently communicating to others that they, as well, could find more love, comfort, and appreciation if they copied his act?





Has the evolution of those boring slide shows that grandparents used to relish turned into something more -- more human, perhaps?

When the \Redskin\ fans took a pig and painted it red and put a miniature feathered war bonnet on its head and proceeded to chase it around the football field at halftime, for me that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
Rumors are Lebanon's daily bread with legacy media and citizen journalists accused of fanning the flames amid domestic political unrest, economic uncertainty, and regional upheaval whose sparks are burning Lebanese fingers.


It's all ridiculously blatant cheerleading, and WND is complicit -- what self-respecting news organization would let a so-called reporter present as a \news\ article gushing PR pieces on a film he appears in? It's a textbook example of how to violate journalistic ethics.
It amazes me that there is absolutely no coverage about the atrocities against the indigenous Christians of Iraq and Syria.











I believe relatively soon we will all agree -- and write into national law -- that PII includes more than your Social Security number, and that name, address and ZIP should be not be shared on media sources or other public forums without extreme cause. T







If you don't have the opportunity or bandwidth to write, request to sit down with a journalist -- completely independent of any other agenda. Ask them what their day is like, what their job entails, what makes a good story for them and so on.


Let's face it







If a person is going to make an argument or declaration that includes facts or even just an effort to persuade, then they must at least adhere to the lowest common denominator of a written argument to be taken seriously.


With the continued fragmentation of media, we need to return to telling stories because it sets our message apart and helps our meaning ring clear amid the noise in the marketplace of attention.




The Pine Ridge Reservation recently held an election to determine whether the sale of alcohol should be approved on the reservation. The majority of voters said \yes.\

We discussed the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight 17, the Russian-made Buk-M1 2 Missile System and the criminal charges against FedEx on The Weekend Show with Kenny Shelton Saturday July 19, 2014 on The Virginia Talk Radio Network.






There is an art of war and there is an art to selling war -- to one's own people, and the world at large.
The journalistic cowardice of peppy, preening, self-absorbed muppets is not a sign of a coming apocalypse. It is, however, a symptom of national decline. If you can't face the future with open eyes, you're probably afraid of where you're going.

In April of 2013, Tia Lessin and Carl Deal's film \Citizen Koch\ died an untimely death.  The film had sought to illustrate the role of Koch money in American electoral politics.







Fox's messaging that government is bad, that human nature is intrinsically more evil than good, that people should be afraid and paranoid, isn't journalism covering the news. It's a world view and narrative that is embedded in the identity and agenda of America's political right wing.

























ven if that audience isn't willing to pay directly for content, membership packages allow newspapers to offer something different, an emotional connection with their core readers complemented by special deals and opportunities. Expect memberships to become a more common feature.





It's true, most of us will never have the resources to be major financial players in political campaigns. Our advocacy lies in our voice, and in our wallets.
