Grace Stevens is a transgender woman and a leader in the transgender community who transitioned at the age of 64. She is a father of three and a grandparent of two.
It was colorful. It was political. It was flamboyant. It was touching. And I wouldn't have expected anything less when about 100,000 people converged in the center of Mexico City on June 27, for the 37th edition of the Marcha por el Orgullo Gay, the annual Mexico City LGBT pride march and festival that grows in scope every year.
What a historic time we live in! As the world celebrated Pride throughout the month of June, the United States Supreme Court deemed same sex marriage legal and the world came together to prove that #LoveWins.
Jeremy Renner doesn't care if you think he's gay.\u00a0 As has been the case with many celebrities, Renner's sexuality has been
He was stirring green beans and butter in a red plastic bowl, when I realized I could watch the way Paul held that fork for the rest of my life. That was the dividing line. There was the time before I knew I loved him and the time after.
It's been a weird couple of days. My 17 year old self would be so happy right now. After crying in a counselling office when Bush was re-elected and all of my Southern Californian classmates rejoiced, I would have lauded this day.
As a Los Angeles resident I had seen numerous billboards featuring a curious man inviting me to his salon. His name

In this current bride-centric wedding culture, the needs of men of all orientations are often lost in the shuffle. The current resources don't really address the needs of men when it comes to what to wear, how to plan and what to expect when planning such an important event.
\I mean, obviously, I blushed,\ Bomer said of Tatum's apparent man crush.


Much of the focus now is rightly on celebrating this important victory. But it is worth pausing to consider what the dissenting Supreme Court justices had to say Friday because it presages what we can expect in the coming LGBT rights battles -- battles that will not be for marriage equality but for equality, period.

Coming from a mostly diverse kindergarten, you are accustomed to being around all different types of kids from all different walks of life, whether you realized it or not. \Your parents had you before they were married. They're going to hell.\ Welcome to the life of a Catholic schoolgirl.
Long before I was walking, they were marching. The pioneers of gay rights, gay visibility, gay pride first took to the streets of New York City in 1970 to march. And somewhere on this long road, a company started marching, too. And then another and another. First to us, then for us, then as us.



While these Supreme Court decisions do not touch on issues of gender identity and expression, they do remove the justification that courts have used to deny trans persons their rights -- that by refusing to recognize their gender transitions they were entitled to invalidate legal marriages as same-sex marriages.



Dressed in matching blue T-shirts, the men crooned a rousing version of \The Star-Spangled Banner\ on the steps of the Supreme Court itself.
A lone woman stood on the Supreme Court steps ranting about homosexuality destroying our country. She had become an expired parody. She had lost relevance. She and the millions like her had become ghosts in that moment. And she knew it. And we knew it.

There is officially marriage equality in America. And all l I can think about is how I can now finally get married to Justin Timberlake (sorry, Jessica).
In one week the court has said yes, you can keep your health care America. Then the people said that a 150 year old flag was, in fact, bigotry and hatred. And now, the court again has said that gay people can marry in all 50 states. Not a bad week for Americans.


Today is a historic day for the LGBT community. Thanks to the Supreme Court's decision this morning, marriage equality is now a reality in 50 states. We now have more access to healthcare, more protection from discrimination, and more power in our political process than ever before.
Typically, the vast majority enter the sex trade in their teens through late twenties. However, this first in a raw and candid three-part series explores why a man of a certain age became a porn actor/model when he was nearly 40--and his career in that industry.
I have been married for 12 years. When I announced my engagement 13 years ago to family and friends, I received love and excitement from almost everyone. It was a normal engagement and very exciting time for my future husband and I.



Every year now the folks over at Barefoot Wine & Bubbly throw a gay pride party and every year the party gets better and the crowds get bigger and this year was absolutely no exception.

\I'm glad to have lived long enough to see all the changes,\ he says gesturing with his hands. \Sometimes I've been angry because we (gays, lesbians, transgenders) are human beings. We're entitled to the same rights as everyone.\
In a world that is saturated in patriarchy and gender based violence, imagine how powerful and life saving it would be if men, masculine presenting people and cis-gender identified people started standing up as allies too.
Androgyny is not something often considered beautiful, so for Ruby Rose to redefine beauty and still have mass appeal is very exciting. But it does raise questions over why some gender non-conformity is celebrated while other forms are ridiculed or ignored.

When my partner and I finally decided to plan a wedding, 10 years into our relationship, a certain anxiety began to set in. Was this celebration going to put us into a lifetime of debt?
There are countless gay couples who, by virtue of their zip codes, have sat on the sidelines of this revolution. Send a message that families like ours have value.


We are unlikely ever to uncover the 'truth' of Cic's sexual identity. But engaging\u00a0with\u00a0Cic' allows us to think about the past differently, and also to engage with the present. For queer men and women today, it's critical to see that there is a queer history, even if they\u00a0don't map precisely onto today's understandings of LGBT.
The cause was something that hit close to home. The Happy Hippie Foundation works to fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBT youth and other vulnerable populations. I'm proud to say that I'm me... and I'm part of the LGBT community.
I have known Jeremy Sullivan since I started my freshman year at Nixa High School in Nixa, MO. He was both my English and my Speech and Debate teacher. My first thought of Mr. Sullivan was that he was such a character and that he was different than many of my former teachers.


If we look to her for a lesson in transgender identity, we may be left wanting. But if we scale back to put her unique story in its time and place and in a wide and rich history, some valuable things come into focus.

No matter what I said or did, you would never go away. There was so many things you couldn't control, like the simple fact that you were in a same-sex relationship at a time in America when that was abhorred. You couldn't make us happy. But you could control if you stayed or left, and you always stayed.

Fathers don't have to be biologically related to their children. Dads can be queer. They can be kind. Fathers shouldn't have anything to do with upholding patriarchal male standards. Fathers are all genders. Fathers can be so much more then what our traditional view of them is.



The joy of Pride isn't really about whether the Supreme Court rules in our favor. We all hope that 2015's Pride will bring another great legal triumph. But in the end, Pride has, does, and will matter even more.

I am still in love with the person I married back in 1984. A person who today is a she. I have witnessed true joy in the person I've grown a life with -- a person whose blue eyes shine because she feels right in her own skin.

The new web series Paper Boy highlights the unifying theme for every person in their 20's, regardless of race, religion, or sexual orientation

There's a Balinese song on loop/repeat at the dining area of our modest, Sanur Beach hotel. It could be the soundtrack for an insane asylum. Frantic wooden flutes and vibraphones, playing a hectic, repetitive pattern.
It's funny how obscure you act when I enter a room. Yes, I see you glancing up casually from eating your burrito to examine me as I wait in line. You forget to finish chewing.
We hear a lot lately in the news about \religious freedom,\ and business owners who assert that their religious beliefs preclude them from doing business with gay people.
With lesbians, gays, and bisexual service members now having equal opportunity protection in the military, one question that I hear all the time in the Special Warfare community is, \How do I work with somebody who is gay, or I think is gay?\
June is Pride Month and I have to say that I'm feeling a lot of pride myself this year. Seeing all the Pride flags up and down the streets of NY and LA (and other cities) just fill me with happiness.
Allowing gender to dictate who you can marry is gender discrimination, plain and simple. And Americans get that.
The inclusive message of the ad, a Chobani spokeperson told The Huffington Post, is in line with the company's longtime support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.





The freedom to marry feels inevitable in 2015. But is it? And how did we get here?
I am going to tackle head-on the conservative attack on Caitlyn Jenner that has erupted since the Rachel Dolezal story broke. I will leave the response to Dolezal to others to parse, but I will take my colleague, Jonathan Capehart's advice and \move along\ to, once again, school the conservatives in biology.

Our PFLAG chapter recently sponsored a session on the so-called \clobber verses\ in the Bible. These aptly named verses are the pretext Christians use to oppose GLBT rights. A twenty-something woman came to the session, and afterwards, she had a question for the speaker.

Should LGBTQ people automatically get along with each other because they are designated as a minority group that has endured decades of oppression and stigmatization? LGBTQ organizations have only hired leaders who are invested in white, privileged, able-bodied, patriarchal politics.
The single biggest risk factor for developing cancer is age and older LGBTQ people are more likely to be living alone when cancer strikes. While we might wish that a lifetime of family rejection would be reversed upon hearing of a cancer diagnosis, sadly that is not always the case.

When one person becomes synonymous with an entire group, it's easy to forget that her experiences are not the norm.


Caitlyn Jenner travels in the rarefied Hollywood air where she can get the best everything to make her transition a resounding success worthy of the Vanity Fair cover. But in the end, members of her beloved Republican Party are plotting to humiliate her and other transgender Americans.



Today, post-Jenner, with the surrender of many religious conservatives on the impending \redefinition of marriage,\ they can no longer afford to treat trans persons as afterthoughts. We must be attacked head-on theologically. That, however, is proving to be rather difficult.
I doubt the people who took a stand on a hot summer evening at the Stonewall Inn knew their acts of defiance would usher in a new era of LGBT rights. Oh how I wish we could go back to that day in 1969 to tell all those people what was ahead.


June is Gay Pride Month. It is a time for parades and for festivals, for rainbow flags and for dance tents. It is a time to recognize the amazing progress that has been made on LGBT equality as we recommit ourselves to continuing the struggle until liberty and justice for all really means \all.\


As I read about people criticizing social media for calling Caitlyn Jenner a hero, I think of my friend and all she went through. A hero is someone who puts other lives before their own. A hero can come in many forms.

What I think I like best about Reclaimed is a distinction film critic Manny Farber made between elephant art and termite art. Elephant art comes in, steps all over you, then stomps out.

Fun Home tells the story of Alison, a young girl growing up in a funeral home with a closeted father. The musical is based on Alison Bechdel's graphic novel and it weaves her coming out and coming of age story with her father's own tragic struggle towards self-realization.

Caitlyn Jenner could have, as the professional she is, presented herself in a manner that did not slide in so smoothly with the routine sexual objectification of the American woman, and that opens her, and by extension the rest of us, to the claim that she's playing out an erotic fantasy.


There are some within the community who will be not as welcoming as others; pointing to your privilege over the vast majority of trans women, and excluding you for it, forgetting that just as with the cisgender population, there are women of all social classes, shapes and sizes who are transgender.

An NBC station in Tennessee is refusing to broadcast footage of a gay soldier who wants to get married. The governor of North Carolina vetoed a bill that would let state officials turn gay couples away from marriage counters -- but the bill's not dead yet.
Will the Supreme Court be influenced by what has happened in Ireland or will they deflect and bat the ball back to individual states thus avoiding -- or simply delaying -- having to make a firm decision?
What about fans who wear sizes larger than a 3x who are seemingly shut out of the entire realm of tee shirt fandom? Should they just buy a CD and an embossed baseball cap?
It is ironic and telling that the people of Ireland on May 22 voted to enshrine same-sex marriage rights into its constitution by an almost two-to-one margin. They seemed to have no problem in riding above complicated and esoteric legal arguments, as well as the proscriptions of the Church.
With Pride month upon us LGBT folks from throughout the country will spend the month partying and taking Pride in our community. Flags will fly and parades will be had. In many ways mainstream America will witness the media perpetuated stereotype of LGBT community.
When the gender diagnosis came, a part of me was super scared and a part of me was relieved. I realized that as long as we actively managed the situation and made decisions together, we would be fine.
The energy in the room at the end of the day is buoyant. People are smiling and laughing. Several linger behind to discuss the incredible conversations that we have had.


I like to think of this time of year as Parenting Season, the span between Mother's Day and Father's Day. It can be a challenging time for LGBTQ parents and our kids, since we don't fit into those two categories in the traditional way -- but it can also be a great time to celebrate and raise awareness about our families.







This past weekend wasn't just the unofficial start of summer; it's the official start of Pride season. In the coming month the sunlight will not only stay out longer but cities will start flying the rainbow flag to celebrate their LGBT communities.



Maybe, just maybe, do these events show how asinine it is to make statements connecting God's supposed wrath against gay marriage to a disaster in the first place?
Ryan O'Connell got his start much in the same way as any other up and coming writer - working a string of all but unpaid internships, and harvesting his life for awkward/relatable experiences to blog about for the internet.
I am pretty sure that these shows will never be on my regular \must see\ list, but I was able to separate the larger-than-life reality show, the reported money-making machine, and found I could identify with the human feelings that were expressed,
I first met Violet Chachki in 2012 when she was an itsy-bitsy baby queen coming up in the Atlanta drag scene. She was so young back then, she couldn't even be served alcohol where she was performing!

The landslide victory for marriage equality in Ireland caught some conservatives off guard. What happened to the staunchly conservative, almost fanatical Catholicism of the Irish people? Paul Valleley, a professor of public ethics at the University of Chester, offered some important suggestions. He lists two major reasons.


Thank you to every \yes\ campaigner in Ireland. From a 52-year-old gay American, I feel very, very Irish today. As a country and as a people, you have my continued love. As an example to the world today you shine like no other.







Lately, \the gays\ have been blamed for a long list of ills, both real and imagined. The looming prospect of nationwide marriage equality has sent some social conservatives around the bend. It is not just twisters for which we are on the hook.
Like many of you, I have been eagerly following the news about the Supreme Court hearing on marriage equality. This is undoubtedly an exciting time for our movement and I am holding my breath hoping for a historic win. It is also the time to start the community conversation about the next chapter of our movement.



The narrative playing out in the media and in state capitals across the country is that LGBT freedom advances only at the detriment of religious liberties, and vice versa. That doesn't have to be the case. By bringing both sides together with mutual respect, we were able to move Utah in the right direction.
There have been a number of actresses who've played extremely strong, tough characters in recent years -- Meryl Streep and Reese Witherspoon to name a few -- which have been very well received and widely accepted by audiences. But the gay love story still presents a set of new challenges entirely.

Texas is setting itself up for a showdown with the Supreme Court. A bill to defy the court's rulings died in the House last week, but anti-gay politicians could find a sneaky way to revive it. Meanwhile, the Attorney General of Texas refuses to say if he'll obey the Supreme Court's ruling in June.


Police must change their perspective from enforcing to protecting. They must know and respect the communities they serve. They must not be above the law. Change will occur only if we push for it together. Let's be about it.

New York City's Times Square - with its throngs of visitors, office workers, hawkers of fake designer wear and life-sized Elmos and Buzz Lightyears - today serves as the unusual setting for a United Nations video launch.
In states that have legalized marriage for gays and lesbians, the only change in those contracts was the genders. A few pronouns were switched, but when gay couples marry, everything else still works exactly the same way.
Welcome to the final part of \Depression's Peculiar Grip on Black LGBTQs.\ As I've stated, I'm writing this multi-part series to shine a bright light on how depression can have a more pronounced and peculiar effect and impact on black LGBTQ persons.
As the Supreme Court gets ready to hopefully legitimize a belief that many of us in the LGBT community already consider an inalienable right -- marriage equality for all -- it's high time we start preparing ourselves for the next major issue to address
Homosexuality is Not an Addiction is the title of a piece that just came out on Psychology Today. Dr. David Ley's piece cannot be ignored in the conversation on LGBTQ rights and \conversion therapy.\
Admit it, you're kinda intrigued but also put off by gay pride parades. Maybe \put off\ is too strong a term for you. Perhaps you're, say, perplexed by them? Yes, perplexed -- how's that?
Being this popular has plugged me into a community, and has helped me to unearth the people who say yes without hesitation -- who feel the way I do. These are the people who, for whatever reason, are outsiders like me. Connecting with them is priceless.








HIV Equal Online's second episode of Unzipped explores what can make sex good, and what can make it bad. Watch as nine guys talk about the last time the had fun in the sack, and the last time they wanted to jump out and run screaming.

Most people believe in freedom of speech. Most people also believe that a business shouldn't have the right to discriminate against customers for their religious and political beliefs. But what if you were faced with a situation where you had to choose?
On April 28th, I had the chance to go stand on the steps of the Supreme Court with my family to support same-sex couples' right to be legally married in every state.
This week I talked with Rabbi Jack Moline, Executive Director of Interfaith Alliance about an inspirational campaign launched by Interfaith Alliance called the \Everyone Only\ project.

Bruce stands on the shoulders of those before. His acceptance is only possible because of the courage of those who resisted at Stonewall, and the countless others who have rebelled against intolerance while simply attempting to be the people they felt themselves to be. They are our heroes and heroines.



For many years, media portrayals of LGBTQ people focused on one type of experience -- that of the white, gay, urban man living a fabulous life in a coastal city. While people living that experience are an important part of our community, many other voices and stories haven't been consistently heard.
How can members of LGBTQ communities be allied with those in Baltimore? We shut up for a while and seek out a different moment in time for our voices to be heard. We listen to those closest to the pain and rage. We do better at processing our anguish and the anguish of others before we speak about that pain.
Last year at this time, my then first-grader asked me to take her to the father-daughter dance at her school repeatedly, and every time, my refusal made her cry. She begged and whined, \Why, Daddy, why?\ What I was too ashamed to explain last year at this time was that I was afraid around other dads because I didn't look like a dad.
So here's my quandary
The atmosphere was electric and the excitement and anticipation palpable, as over a thousand LGBT people from all across the country gathered in Washington D.C. for the historic marriage equality arguments before the United States Supreme Court last Tuesday.

We've all been there
On Tuesday, the eve of Forty To None Day (a day of national awareness of the epidemic of homeless youth) I got the opportunity to meet with Grammy, Emmy, and Tony Award-Winning artist (and my teen shero) Cyndi Lauper when I presented a $160,000.00 check to True Colors Fund, a youth charity Lauper co-founded.

As expected, civil rights legend Mary Bonauto knocked it out of the park for marriage equality. But something bigger was in the air -- a sense that history wasn't just turning but had, in some basic sense, turned.
The title says it all. This sketch is absurd and yet perfect.
This week's episode features Johann, a South African man who grew up closeted and lonely until he discovered the gay community in a place he could never have imagined as a child


In this episode of Nicholas Snow Live, I welcome Food Network star and original Queer Eye for the Straight Guy cast member, Ted Allen, spokesperson for Dining Out For Life, Emmy Award-winner and host of the primetime series Chopped on The Food Network.

We now have seen \The Interview\ with Bruce Jenner.  I can't help but reflect on how similar his journey seems to be to the one I traveled only a few short years ago. However, there is one big difference.
I'm so grateful that technology has evolved enough to where LGBT youth can discover support systems online that provide a palpable \Plan B\ to some of the hateful and absurd messages being offered at the pulpit.
I found myself unexpectedly emotional as I watched Bruce Jenner bravely share such a personal story with the world. I tried to grasp why I felt differently than I had with any other transgender \coming out\ story, and my reasons were many. But foremost on my mind, as always, were my camp kids.
Metropolitan Community Churches are proud to say marriage equality has been part of our DNA for almost 50 years. One of the first things our founder, Rev. Elder Troy Perry, did after forming Metropolitan Community Church in 1968 was to begin performing marriage ceremonies.
The opportunity this presents for our community to simply tell our stories, have them be heard and, most importantly, to educate -- is what the real legacy of this moment is.
I want to personally thank Bruce for his courage, his candor and his willingness to share his journey. At the very least, it will start a conversation. Please do not get caught up in the politics.  Transgender people are no different than anyone else.
Jenner's message reached across the board, and my hopes are that Bruce's interview, his truth, his explanation of who he is today and where he plans to go in the future with \her,\ has reached people who resonate with his journey. I hope this will push further discussion, acceptance, understanding and most of all, empathy.
I commend Jenner for opening a much-needed area for discussion, and, hopefully acceptance for many. After all, Who says we can't all live together in harmony and enjoy life?
I don't see the contradiction in embracing the good Jenner has done, while respectfully asking \What the heck?\ on his apparently discordant politics -- not to enforce liberal orthodoxy, but to encourage self-reflection in someone who has a unique public platform.
Everyone who transitions does so somewhat publicly, though not all of us have cameras focused on our every move. When we speak of Bruce, hopefully we can remember that Bruce is, at heart, a person, and give him the dignity he is due.
Both homophobia and sexism are part of the structure of the patriarchy. They are the most enduring building blocks in the construction of prejudice. And when those ideas come from within the gay community, we have a paradoxical situation.

There is a pervasive cultural myth that all gays are rich, and that all Asian Americans are overachievers. Individuals who identify as LGBTQ and AAPI are therefore often assumed to be better off. However, these misconceptions all too often mask real struggles and hardships faced by LGBTQ AAPI communities.

I want to caution that for all the drama, excitement, enthusiasm and analysis sparked by the political dimension of the marriage equality debate, there is also a deeply personal dimension that is easy to overlook. It is the collateral damage of systemic homophobia that accelerates when marriage equality is in the news cycle.

The anti-gay right seem to be painting a portrait of victimhood in anticipation of further progress by the LGBT community and the goal is most likely to stop this progress. But I have one question.  How in the hell can anyone forget how we got to this point?
How was this happening all over again? Why did the Governor decide that it was in his power to pick and choose which laws he was going to enforce?
Alan Bounville walked 6,000 miles for gender-identity and sexual-orientation equality. But what happened early on in his walk, at a small grocery store in a rural town, is what led him to one of his most memorable experiences.
He would also edit my writing, organize my closets and plan adventurous weekends at outer-borough museums and trips to Hindu temples. He was, in short, my dream man. So could a real committed relationship work?


The discussion about whether Bruce Jenner is transitioning has me feeling simultaneously hopeful and deeply uncomfortable. Uncomfortable because, as a daughter of a \transparent,\ the tabloid tone of ridicule with which the speculation has been presented recalls the cruel words I heard behind my back growing up.
We look forward to leaders from around the world coming to Israel in June, taking this opportunity to participate in the conference, to see the community and the country for themselves, and to join in the celebration of Tel Aviv Pride. We will be stronger together.
I grew up with the Internet and social networking, so online dating feels, somehow, more natural than walking up to a good-looking guy in public and saying, \Hey, I'm Tom. How's your week/end going?\
This is not the time to grow complacent, but it is the time to celebrate our achievements to date and then recommit our time, voices and resources to ensure the fight against discrimination continues. Say #IDo as a symbol of America's collective resolve to ensure \Liberty and Justice for All.\
What pragmatic liberals like me are calling for is not surrender on the part of progressives, but political maturity. Hillary is far better than any GOP candidate. If she is the Democratic nominee, those who don't want to see a century of reforms decimated should give her their vote.
I've rounded up the weirdest Supreme Court briefs that argue in favor of preventing gays and lesbians from marrying. Some are full of mistakes, others have baffling arguments. And at least one is incredibly sexist, and signed by a member of Congress.
The anti-gay Family Research Council has a new video about how the gays are ruining everything, what with their pesky marrying and buying of cakes and, well, simply existing. And this video isn't just a video -- it's part of a crafty advertising campaign.
Though there have been setbacks, it is clear that the arch of rights-based gay movements is bending toward justice. But part of conservative thinking for some is a language that places those who victimize members of LGBTQ communities in the position of the victim.

What's the entertainment that made you who you are today? That Eagle conversation left me wanting to find more of the formative media that shaped gay men's lives. I've never read any Isherwood, and haven't seen Mame. What else have I been missing?

When I stood in the crowd with my pink glasses and suit, I understood the purpose of my life. That I was born into a world where I loved my mamma, and I loved my gay dad and I loved my cowboy uncle. That's what love is about, knowing that none of us are so different that we don't share something.



In the days leading up to our encounter a peculiar thing happened -- I panicked. All along I had convinced myself that the shoot was a hero's journey designed to combat ageism and show our community that we're sexy, vital and important at any age. Turns out it wasn't the world that needed reassurance -- it was me.
For years, the dominant question for LGBT professionals was whether it was safe to be out at work. Though the battle is far from over, the growing acceptance of gay marriage and the coming out of prominent executives like Apple's Tim Cook has moved the discourse to the next level.
When I hear someone say something prejudicial about one person or a group of people, it's as if they are saying it about all of us. If they are attacking one group today, then they'll be attacking another group tomorrow. Everyone gets a turn.


Of all the queens to come out of RuPaul's Drag Race, there are very few as universally loved and revered as Latrice Royale. I caught up with Latrice during some of her very rare free time to chat about what's new in her life and her thoughts on the past and future of drag.


\I think that everyone just desires to be and to feel loved. Accepted. Not tolerated (I think that word is gross.) There are so many of us who go through life not feeling loved and completely alone, dealing with some huge circumstances by ourselves. I don't want that.\
Almost every time I go out in the gayborhood, I experience some form of ageism. Age shouldn't matter -- because it doesn't. It's the 21st century, and the only things truly dated about us are our idealisms.


It's 2015 and gays like myself are still here, still queer and people seem to be getting used to us. Sort of.

Shame. It governs our lives in more ways than we'd want it to. Any cringe, embarrassment, infraction of social norms; It is a learnt mechanism to pull us back into a narrative that we have been told our whole lives.



With the ongoing incidents concerning inappropriate police shootings, the call for body cameras is getting increasingly louder. So loud that scores of police departments across the nation have already implemented or begun implementation of the technology.



Never before did I think that relieving myself of bodily waste was a radical act.

While it may not have been Tammy's intent, posing this seemingly innocuous question is a poorly disguised microaggression that perpetuates the belief that Asian-Americans are cultural and racial outsider within the American context. T








When I attend social functions, people focus on my disability. No matter how hard I try to discuss the news or the hottest restaurant, people always revert back to my lack of sight. And at gay parties, people tend to ask more intimate questions.



Never before has Republican flailing been on such vivid display, nor has the right's disconnect from mainstream American opinion been more glaring. We should seize the moment and make the GOP pay a heavy price.
If you're fortunate enough to live half a century, you'll understand that it isn't that youth is wasted on the young, it's that youth has no bearing on happiness.
I was actually born with a body that matched my agender identity. I didn't make sex hormones. But I was bullied so viciously for looking androgynous, I chose to be \normal.\ And now I have cis regret.



Considering Indiana has now become a national joke for LGBT discrimination, it was a sharp reminder that not everyone in the state echoes the legislature's pro-discrimination stance.

I'm officially announcing to the world that I, Neal Wooten, blogger for the Huffington Post, also do not currently operate a pizza joint, and furthermore, at the risk of angering a lot of fair-minded decent people who stand up for equal rights, I also will not cater to gay weddings. Please set up my Go Fund Me account as soon as possible.


While I have learned to do everything the blind way, I always find myself teaching others how to interact with me -- something I've become better at with time. And, one of the main themes I battle with, especially in the gay community, is the importance of beauty.
Where Frank looked for legal and legislative victories, Signorile takes us further into a path towards winning the American psyche. He points out that positive opinion polls only tell a surface story.



One person really can make a difference. For Ron Huberman, all it took to find himself on the path toward an accomplished life was meeting Harvey Milk. The fateful day came after a cross-country road trip from New York to San Francisco.
Gay and bisexual men want to contribute to America's blood stocks and have a vital role to play in keeping America healthy. We should demand that the FDA change its policy and keep stereotypes out of blood donation sites.


After the big win, I was entitled to a real investigation. And I proved it. On all counts, I proved they discriminated against me and I won. Macy v. Holder then started to walk, talk and have a life of its own. My child began to grow.

It is heartening to see the swift condemnation against Indiana's new law from state governments, technology leaders, athletic organizations and community organizations. The pressure should be kept up, even as the governor and lawmakers say they want to \clarify\ the law's intent.
Why would a gay person want a wedding cake baked by bigots? I don't think any of us would. I certainly wouldn't. But if it's legal for a business owner to discriminate, like it currently is in Indiana, then wedding cake shoppers have to be on the defense.
I would not be here today if it wasn't for the free, quality health care I was given in the form of Medicaid. I support the ACA and I advocate for a single payer national health insurance system. This is what we all need in order to be a society in which our ideals are realized rather than sold off. We can't go backwards, there's just too much at stake.
The results from our national Funniest Drag Queen Name poll are in!  With 4,293 votes cast on 40 finalists we finally have our winners...
As a depressed and isolated queer young person, I never thought I would one day have a husband, be living in the gayest city in the world, and be writing a letter like this to people like you.



I liked the show because it finally presented a world I could relate to. It was refreshing to see a show that dealt with the issues that concern me and my community

Meanwhile, there is another story out of Indiana that hasn't been mentioned in this mess and it should. Indiana is in the midst of an HIV crisis.


You might be thinking, \Amelia, this isn't going to go anywhere. It's California! It's not like it's going to become law.\ And you are right. But it doesn't take away from the fact that there are thousands of people in this country just like Mr. McLaughlin, who think a bullet in his head is exactly what my son deserves.
What's it like to navigate the gay world when you're deaf? Richard Mesich shares his story, beginning with his coming-out experience.
These next few years, as hard as they might be for you, will pass quickly. I know you want to end it all right now; I know you feel like it's the only thing that will stop the pain. But you have NO idea how wonderful the future is going to be!

The Mattachine brief, and the archival rescue that went into it, is in partial payment of an historic debt. But victory in the marriage cases will not complete that debt.
I didn't die. Instead I thrived. I learned all I could; I saw the best doctors that community health, and occasional private insurance, could provide. And today, 27 years post infection with an AIDS diagnosis, I am undetectable with a healthy t-cell count.


I'm sorry that your pain has brought you to a place that has you advocating a position that is guaranteed to cause more pain to other children. You must know that children will continue to be raised by same-sex couples. Gay marriage doesn't deny children anything. It grants them equality.
I don't have a word for being a girl who was assigned \female\ at birth; identifies as a girl; grew up dressing like (and still sometimes dresses like) a boy; once dated men but now dates women; eats meat, vegetables, gluten, and dairy; is white; has blonde hair and blue eyes; and is short.  That's why we have names.  I'm just Shaina.
I was tentative about saying the \L word;\ it was a big step for me -- especially considering that Lucas and I had never actually met. In person, that is. The Internet has, indeed, made the world a very small place.

That word has been used against us in the past. But you can't use a word against someone who already calls that word their own. So I claim it. I own. I use it, and I wear it. I am queer.




When Michael Coulter left Flint, Michigan, and went to college, he \met more gay people in one hour\ than he had in his entire life. But there was one who caught his eye, and that boy would become his first love. As the school year continued, Michael's feelings only grew stronger, and with summer break approaching, he felt like he was ready to share his feelings.



Are other guys having the same experience you are on the gay dating apps? We wondered, too. So we conducted a a nationwide survey of nearly 4,000 gay men last month to gauge their behavior.


It seems clear to me that here we have an example of the kind of institution that excludes us. We can see the mechanisms of exclusion and the culture from which they stem. We see that we are not the only ones excluded and should speak up for each other.
The deeper issue for me lies in the fact, that by not having access to these spaces, I am denied the opportunity to safely show off my sexuality. I am denied the chance to be anonymous. I am denied the possibility of the prowl, the chase and rolling up in my chair to go in for the kill.
They say two LGBTQ groups in Boston were invited to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade this year.  Progress is measured in years.  We can't always see it.  It moves too slow at times.  But this year, I can certainly attest -- with the changes on parade, the long road to equality has dutifully risen to meet me.
The current bifurcated restroom designation contradicts the realities of peoples' sexed bodies, gender identities and gender expressions.
Current readers should be aware of what stories are being told and packaged by New York publishing houses and engage in healthy skepticism. Looking beyond the glossies, readers can find gems like Vernita Gray.


It is perfectly okay with me if someone wants to believe that they know more about my gender than I do. However, I kind of have trouble when they try to tell me that I have to take their delusional daydream and create my own personal nightmare.

As I look back on my life full of obstacles, I vividly remember the moments of overcoming them instead of the strife they caused. I hope as my son grows he will feel the same. The moment of pride and joy received when achieving a goal especially when others doubted your success can never be duplicated.








Coaches are often teachers, mentors and guides. The impact of a good coach is not limited to the pitch, ice, court, or water, as what they teach us has the potential to shape how we see ourselves. They inspire and instruct, teaching us not only how to play better, but also how to be better.


After the 2014 election we knew we would be losing ground for a couple of years. The crop of incoming conservatives featured many new, terrifyingly crazy anti-LGBT legislators.

Despite his tireless work on behalf of gay and progressive causes, Chuck often remained closeted about his business. Even in death, his name and money carried a stigma.
Years of international campaigning have finally turned the world's attention to Iran's failure to uphold the human rights of LGBTI people, and perhaps Iran realized that their shameful persecution of individuals based on their sexual orientation, or private intimate acts, is nothing to be proud of.
So I took off my clothes and told the story of my gender transition for a What's Underneath video, as part of my Being Transgender -- Naked project. The first question that the creators of the series asked me afterward was
The point of this fashion flashback is to emphasize that if there was a specific moment I 'discovered' I was gender different, it was long before I can remember. I was always me -- always wanting to wear a dress.
Well, it seemed like marriage was safe in Alabama, but the state Supreme Court still had a one weird trick up its sleeve. Even though a federal court ordered marriage to begin, the Alabama Supreme Court has now ordered it to stop.




There is a larger educational point that needs to be said loud and clear for the benefit of other families and for transgender or gender nonconforming youth. That message is simple


With this thirteenth record, Madonna is telling us she has not, does not, and will not ever stop her campaign against breaking the rules of gender, sex, and the limits placed on her own humanity.

Coming out once is hard enough. But for Benjamine Heath, he had to come out to his mother three times, once as gay, once as owning a porn company, and once as being in a polyamorous relationship.
As the reputed Republican Hopeless for the 2016 presidential election, Carson takes every opportunity to congratulate himself on his ability to speak his mind at any cost -- the cost in this case being the reinforcement of an utterly nonsensical and dangerous notion, but the cost in all cases being rationality and someone else's well-being.

As a Christian, I stand in embarrassment at what some in my religion deem as right and \godly.\ It's the reason I have searched for 8 years, trying to find a church that promotes God's love without exacting man's judgment.
Sadly, LGBT kids are more likely to be thrown out of their birth homes or to be removed from them as a result of abuse or neglect.
This whole gay lifestyle thing sounds so decadent and hedonistic and sinful, like a two thousand calorie dessert and here I am gay and living my boring little life, paying my children's college bills, remaining faithfully married to my husband and taking out the trash. Clearly, I have missed out.

Being a two-dad family, it was a little annoying to see yet one more thing that made us feel invisible. However, we were still jumping through hoops to complete our adoption, and advocating in our home state to legalize same-sex marriage. We had more important battles to wage.


There are far fewer hate comments than there are love comments. As Ms. Swift said, haters gonna hate. But it may be nice to know that lovers gonna love, too. I'm serious.
Before kids, we went to Turkey, South Africa and Thailand and even contemplated Lebanon. But after two adoptions and the current state of LGBT rights worldwide, our safe zones have become greatly reduced.
Now, perhaps more than ever before, black people are joining forces and standing up for their rights and recognition. Yet, there is still disharmony within that same united front when it comes to accepting our transgender brothers and sisters.



We know that countless numbers of men and women have been, and continue to be, persecuted simply for being who they are.  We understand how fortunate we are just to be able to raise our children and to glimpse the possibilities in store for them.


I have always been a loner. Even as a child, when my family and friends were off attending parties I would be sequestered in my room, sketchpad in hand, stereo by my side, listening to seductive R&B. Solitude was something I took for granted.
Failure to adequately protect transgender students means that transgender people and their families often face hostile, unsafe, or unwelcoming school environments. Harassment and violence make it difficult for transgender students to obtain the skills and education they need to succeed.
I'm writing this multi-part series to shine a bright light on depression's disproportionate impact on Black LGBTQ persons. As one who's suffered from this illness throughout periods of his life, I can attest to its near-crippling effects.
Here's their sneaky trick
The gains in marriage equality and LGBT rights come on the heels of decades of queer marches, demands and legal challenges. They did not come from trying to not offend hetero-normativity.
Gov. George Wallace is a reminder that recognition of basic legal rights is an essential start but just a beginning and is insufficient on its own. Rosa Parks and Stokely Carmichael are reminders that the only way to forever remove George Wallace from our schoolhouse door is to marry the fight for legal equality with a vigorous fight for community strength and vitality.
In my line of work, I am obviously not buying planes and islands, but goddamn it I absolutely love what I do and at the end of the day, as long as I make enough to enjoy a pint of ice cream every night, I'm good!
Okay, I saw it. For you, gentle readers, I was tortured for two hours of my precious time and went to see Fifty Shades of Grey, the film. All I can say is I was more disappointed than anticipated... and we all know I had very low expectations.
Although their looks and achievements are certainly of envy, it's clear that even four of the most attractive and successful undergraduate students take nothing for granted. If anything, holding the appearance of \having it all\ propels them to work even harder to defy any notions that gays are weaker, or lesser, than heterosexuals.
Whether the old guard is wising up or dying off is no longer relevant. The gay rights movement is being won person by person, family by family, city by city, with Washington, D.C. a reluctant, self-congratulatory last stop.
Whether it's your weight, your sexuality, issues with your parents, or whatever it is that you beat yourself up for deep down inside, know that you're not perfect. You'll never be perfect. You're not supposed to be perfect. But you will be ok.
We live in a rampantly heteronormative world, where little boys are supposed to do little boy things and little girls are supposed to do little girl things. Any deviation from this norm is, more often than not, greeted with derision and fear.
Sam was in St. Louis to give the keynote speech at an event organized as part of National Black HIV and AIDS Awareness Day, and he was kind enough to agree to answer a few questions. I told him that my interest was in finding out how he sees himself and his place within the gay community and what he thinks his place is within the Black queer community.
The film had a storyline that can only be described as salacious and lurid. The narrative naturally beguiled my 16-year-old closeted self, and added to my own internet cruising for doses of gay culture before regularly deleting the browsing history.

There's a lower barrier to entry in opening up Tinder on your iPhone and furtively switching \interested in\ to men than there is in mustering the courage to go solo star at the nearest gay bar, or probe the dubious depths of Craigslist.


Each year at the Creating Change Conference, we, in collaboration with our local Host Committee, organize hospitality suites that serve specific groups of attendees for whom the cost of food may be prohibitive.




You can shake your head or laugh or call it hippy dippy or whatever you like. But a woman's pussy is a wondrous thing with the most amazing parts and abilities, and it is simply not given its due in our culture. We are over-sexualized in theory, and under-experienced in practice.

The point is

By only focusing on the above mentioned models of sex and disability, and glorifying the sex worker as a saint of sorts for providing such an invaluable experience, we are again placing people with disabilities at a disadvantage.
I'm afraid that readers with a new found interest in kink will be headed down a dangerous path without further education. But, it's precisely for those reasons that while I'll be the first to talk about the problems in the series, you won't see me complaining about the franchise.


Though it may strike you as something less than shocking coming from an analog, Fosse-loving gay guy like me, but I've never cared much for reggae music.  Doesn't everyone like reggae? That said, I do actually like a reggae beat.
Given the network of mutuality in which we live, the health of our whole society improves when we uphold the rights for our LGBT brothers and sisters.
The longboat dropped us off at the debris-riddled Tonsai coast.  The beach was covered in sharp coral, sand bags, garbage and wood pieces from the Tsunami destruction ten years ago.  We climbed out of the boat with all our luggage on our backs and waded through the water to get to dry land. The four-star treatment stops here.
It's been a cold winter.  Very cold.  One of the things that I'm doing to keep warm is to take an imaginary LGBT cruise in my head -- through books -- to exotic lands. The first stop was the land of queer history.
For the state of Alabama, or any other state, to deny gay couples the equal protection of its laws simply because they're gay is not only wrong and immoral, it's arbitrary, illegal and unconstitutional. It's as simple as that.
For several weeks now, GOP congressman Aaron Schock has been at the center of negative media attention because of things he is alleged to be hiding, inspiring ethics complaints. But the one thing reporters are not talking about openly -- yet appear to be wink-winking and nudge-nudging about -- is the question of Schock's sexual orientation. This is glaring and curious.
Brooke Dozier is an amazing young woman based in Houston, Texas. This author has released her new book on Valentine's Day called \I'm the Same Person - Being Gay and Loving God.\
Things are finally settling down in Alabama. We'll take a look at just how messy it got last week, and what happens now. Plus, Justice Ginsburg makes some pretty candid predictions for the Supreme Court's upcoming marriage decision.

Among the distinct chapters of the film, lesbians have a strong moment, but it will take another film, a sequel hopefully, to do justice to the emotional force of love that swept these millions who found out that women together were complete within themselves and with each other.



Kaela Wilton is a 16-year-old student at Onoway Jr./Sr. High School in Alberta, Canada. For an art project, approved by her art teacher and the school principal, she depicted two young men in an affectionate kiss. After its unveiling and subsequent complaints, the school covered the mural and would not allow it to be seen.



Sen. Cruz's \State Marriage Defense Act\ is unlikely to become law anytime soon. Yet it is a good example of the kind of chaotic reaction the U.S. Supreme Court eventually could unleash if it upheld anti-gay state marriage laws in the case it will hear later this term. Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts, are you listening?
Just as a gay man cannot redefine the word \dyke,\ a woman, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, has no right to use \faggot,\ especially in the name of feminism. And to do so is a shame to feminists everywhere.




As Undocumented Queer & Trans* Youth of Color we noticed a repetitive theme in The National Conference on LGBTQ Equality. The conference created an environment where our experiences as youth of color are being told by people who don't necessarily face our situations/struggles.
For some of us, AIDS was a call to action. We created support systems, or stormed the FDA with Act Up. We stayed fully in the mainstream of our lives. We continued to work, to have relationships, to build a future around a \new normal.\ Some of us lost our way.
After decades of fear mongering and arguments that held no basis in fact, the people of this country have decided that love is truly equal and that not allowing people to marry based on sexuality is something now relegated to the history books.
If state judges can get away with ignoring a federal ruling simply because they do not agree with said ruling on whatever grounds, they are giving themselves precedent to ignore any and all federal rulings they do not agree with.
Hostel living reminds me of one particular tour adventure I had. We were touring Ireland with the band, and we played a bar gig somewhere in the country where the fee included housing.  Whoa.  Never in my life had I stayed in such a place.





On the one hand, I must be




I've been learning how to be a lesbian lately, because my boyfriend and I opened our relationship last year. Ten productive months into being a sometimes-lesbian, I still have a lot of questions. So I reached out to Natashia Mower, this lesbian I know personally, to set me, well, gay, I guess.
I met Owen Tate when he was DJing at every hot party in and around NYC and found myself at The Space, his house in Port Jervis, NY where there was revolving door of artists, porn stars, web developers, models, painters and photographers coming through every day.


Although Noelia has sold over 5 million albums worldwide, has massed quite a collection of gold and platinum albums and was named \International Star of the Year\ in Italy, in the U.S. she remains relatively unknown.

This week I talked with Bryan Bishop, Founder and Executive Director of OUTVETS, the first LGBTQ nonpartisan, nonpolitical veterans organization in the nation. OUTVETS mission is to recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices of LGBTQ veterans through social interaction and community service.
I was born in 1982. I have known about HIV and AIDS, seemingly, as long as I have known about any real thing of importance. I know how not to contract the virus. It seems so easy. But, life is not easy; it is not a classroom.
We all know how this script is supposed to go

Throughout this process I've left Barrett the boy and have become Barrett the man. A man who released the shame he felt for wanting to love another man. A man who addressed issues that were holding him back. A man who has started to live authentically. A real man.
We are told we don't want sex often enough. We want it too much. We are too made-up. We are not made-up enough. We should love our bodies. We should hate our disgusting bodies. And articles like \8 Things That Actually Gross Guys Out in Bed\ are examples of the worst of this kind of shaming.

In my latest video on relationships, I speak about how to effectively figure out when it's time to move on from a relationship and how to do it in the name of love. I describe how we can know where our stuff ends and our partner's begins, as well as the unique challenges that can come up for gay men when it comes to drawing the distinction.


Imagine, if you will, that you've been transported to the future.  It is the 50th anniversary of the legalization of same-gender marriage in all 50 states.  We look in on a high-school history class discussing this significant milestone.  The teacher just asked the class to discuss some of the arguments opposing same-gender marriage.
Invasive photos of Kristen Stewart canoodling on a beach with visual effects producer Alicia Cargile recently surfaced in the tabloids, just as Stewart announced she's quitting Hollywood over privacy issues.
In 2015, we are seeing a disturbing uptick in this trend. We have already seen three homicides of trans women of color in January alone. If we are going to act to prevent one more trans woman of color from losing her life, we must act now.
Poz Retreats are international gatherings of people who are either infected or affected by HIV/AIDS who seek to enrich their lives through deeper insights, awareness and connections to both the community and oneself.
While on a \bucketlist\ style adventure from South East Asia to Melbourne, Australia, I decided to document my experiences and exercise my writer's brain.
There are a lot of people who would rather get a good spanking than a box of chocolates for Valentine's Day and I'm all for that. The problem I have with Fifty Shades of Grey is that it's BDSM for Dummies, it's BDSM Lite.

I revere football because it provides an opportunity in pop culture to wrestle with the complexity of identity. It is often through football, for instance, that TV's Glee confronts gender, sexuality, and marginality.


Drag is a celebration. Drag is an attitude.  Characterizing drag queens as \bitchy, catty, dumb, slutty\ is reductive and insulting.  The female persona created by a drag queen is robust, powerful, enduring.  She has moxie, smarts, humor and beauty.
The idea of a polyamorous relationship is probably shocking to a lot of people, but for Bob Lanning and his partner Don, who was often away for his job as an airline pilot, it was just the right thing to do.
No matter how many outlets -- from trashy gossip rags to (supposedly) reputable entertainment magazines -- make claims about Bruce Jenner's current \journey\...

People see parts of themselves in Matt, both good and bad, and then the message sinks in, that these victims are more than icons or figures. They're people who feel love, pain, happiness and sadness.
I adore otters. Otters just seem so cute with their furry bodies and impish grins. Their slender frames move effortlesstly in whatever environment they are in.  Every time I see an otter, I smile and hope they see me back.


Sally Kern, I repent for the amount of dislike I had in my heart towards you, because I realized you don't know God.  Because, if you do know God like I do then you must realize the hate that has spewed from you is a turnoff for those who desire to be Christ-like.
I'd like to follow up on my previous blog post on the Mount Holyoke College controversy surrounding The Vagina Monologues because of the responses I've received. They've run the gamut from praise to condemnation, from thanks for informing the community of an important event in trans history to constructive criticism as well as vicious name calling.
It's crucial for everyone in our community to know that leaving opportunities for health coverage on the table and trying to get along without health care only exacerbates the various health issues that already disproportionately impact LGBT people

Oklahoma State Representative Sally Kern (R) has introduced a bill to officially change the name of the state from Oklahoma to Okernhoma. Kern stated, \By putting my name in the state's name, the people in our great state will be reminded that my opinions are more important than any one person's individual rights.\


The Mormon church punked the national press yesterday by calling a press conference purportedly about their support of some basic rights for LGBTQ people. The press conference was, in fact, mostly about defending Mormons' right to discriminate.
I must strive to move beyond my fears, and experience life with open eyes, an open heart and an open mind. I am limited by my unwillingness to embrace the people who have intimate knowledge of the parts of me I have yet to discover; I have yet to embrace.
If the unconditional love one would think a parent would have for a child instinctively is not enough, and the unconditional love evangelical Christians claim to believe God has for all people is not enough, then let us declare a spiritual revolution and claim our sovereignty as trans people.
Tip #1 - don't do it during the holidays!
Accuracy is absolutely needed to moderate the level of fear of LGBTI Iraqis living in areas controlled by the Islamic State. We know this from experience.


Kris said that he knows now that he stopped transitioning because he was terrified of never finding love as a transgender person. But only a couple months later, Kris would start a journey that would prove how very wrong he was.
While I am very much interested in busting through the haze of lust and courtship to find real love, I must be honest, I have no desire at all to stop playing games. When it comes to dating, I absolutely love playing games. I love the entire pursuit.
No one who has ever come out as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender to their family, particularly their parents, will ever forget that life-altering moment. Sometimes the connective thread will be cut; other times that bond will be deepened, enriched by this new reality.




This past Monday on Martin Luther King Day the themes of social justice, equality, and perseverance resonated strongly for those in attendance at the ninth annual OUTMusic Awards (OMAs). Marketed as \the biggest night in LGBT music,\ the OMAs almost didn't happen.



Whether you're looking for a relationship, a new friend or a hot encounter, location-based social apps are a great way to go. But as we all know, apps can bring out some real basic behavior too.
That word is admittedly a scary one. Most civilized, sane people don't want to be called homophobic. It doesn't mean that you're murdering gay people. It doesn't even mean that you're a homophobe. But...





The V-Day movement and Eve's play continue to evolve and respond to issues of the day, and our work with the movement was meant to be the start of a conversation about including sex and gender minorities. We encourage you to join us in working together to eliminate violence against all women and girls.

If you are ever in doubt about whether to ask some burning question, first ask yourself if you would pose the same question about the body of a non-trans youth or adult, perhaps your own child or a student or neighbor. If the answer is no, don't ask. If you find yourself biting your tongue, keep biting.



Femi Redwood of Milton, Delaware, grew up in an environment that was accepting of both her sexuality and her race, despite the fact that she was one of the few minorities in town. This only made her more observant later in life as she encountered less-accepting people and communities.



I've been thinking a lot lately about the choice actors or actresses have when they decide to \come out\ publicly. When I did it, I got a lot of people genuinely asking why is it necessary? I'd had discussions often about the fact that straight people needn't \come out\ and a personal life is personal, so why bother saying anything.

Desiree Akhavan's first feature film, Appropriate Behavior, written and directed by and starring Akhavan, is generating major buzz. Akhavan was kind enough to make time to sit down with me on the day of her premiere at Lincoln Center. It's safe to say I don't think I've ever laughed this much during an interview.

Britney was there for me when my father and stepmother sent me to rehab for being too gay. Her personal struggles before and after the ensuing years helped me as I readjusted back to school and into college. I didn't care if she shaved her head. I just wanted her to be okay and yes, just wished everyone would leave her alone.
I had the opportunity to sit down with Adore Delano backstage after her show at the TLA in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We chatted social media, ex-boyfriends, her new album, and why she wants to kill Bianca Del Rio.
The fact that an organization with a roster of 200 people can find a way to concretely analyze their privilege sets a standard. I want to believe in a world where we do not shy away from conversations about racial justice.
Yukio Mishima's suicide in November 1970, with its grim invocation of samurai machismo, is probably the most famous moment of his legend. It overshadows everything else, including Mishima's three nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
A video message about the passing of Leelah Alcorn. A word to parents worldwide. And a message to the LGBTQ youth of the world. Don't let go.
Let me break it down for you -- when you have a disability requiring sexy wheels, two truths become apparent.
In this video I break down some of the psychological nuts and bolts of what makes us attracted to the people we want to date. I also mention the unique challenges that gay men and queer people overall face, and how insight into what otherwise has been chalked up to \magic\ can help our relationships in the long run.
Bliss isn't asking for you to consider more carefully the little things - like holding your partner's hand - so that you too feel what she's felt her entire life. She's asking for a greater understanding of your privilege, because all the little things she experiences add up to something pretty big. And that's significant.
When shopping our film around, we were asked to cut Trevor and his entire storyline. Major studio players and sales agents at big agencies all the way down to smaller distribution houses all said they \loved the film\ but needed Trevor to be cut simply because he was gay, as the \core Christian audience will not accept a gay character.\ It wasn't a discussion but an ultimatum.
We don't have to be the same to give each other credit and respect. We don't have to be bossy to teach. Our differences challenge us, but also enrich us.

Leelah please hear this










While this program might seem like an accurate portrayal of the lives of gay Mormons, it's not. It's actually a symptom of a serious problem inside the LDS Church and our Mormon community when it comes to understanding LGBT individuals as a whole, and it proliferates a damaging -- and even deadly -- message, especially for LGBT Mormon youth.
There is a lot of hurt on all sides that boils to the surface when we learn of the suicide of a teen who was desperate for clarity, for acceptance, for love, and for inner peace. But instead of doing the challenging work of finding entry points for discussion that can lead to understanding and eventually acceptance and healing, so often we're reinforcing this \us vs. them\ dichotomy.

You have talked it out with church leaders and maybe even the congregation, and you have decided that you would like your church to be more welcoming to transgender people.
But please - with all due respect - let's stop perpetuating the lie that marriage equality is a threat to religious liberty. Because nothing could be further from the truth. And that, you will recall, is covered in the Ninth Commandment.
When we at Hornet, a gay social network with 4.4 million users, launched our \Know Your Status\ campaign in 2011, it was received with such fanfare that we decided to make it a permanent feature in our app. Now, in light of new science, the feature is evolving with significant enhancements.
Dec. 31 marked seven months of sobriety for this veteran entertainer, who admits that consuming alcohol had been a regular feature of his life since he first started performing in nightclubs at age 21.
In an effort to hasten change, the Transgender Human Rights Institute has begun a petition calling for a permanent end to transgender conversion therapy in Leelah's name. At this point, only with help from the federal government can we hope to see differences made quickly in the United States on this front.
Coming from a Middle Eastern Orthodox heritage, and insulated from lesbian and gay communities, it takes a rebellion to change age-old customs. Rabbi Wolpe took the chance. He risked losing up to half of his Persian congregants. The financial loss would have been substantial, and the split painful.
In 2012 Kylar made history by becoming the first openly transgender person to testify before the U.S. Senate. He was speaking in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. His truthful speech touched me then, and he continues to fight for transgender people now.
After a lot of confusion, the picture's finally clearing up in Florida. And it's looking pretty good
Let us not forget that transgender is an umbrella that encompasses all persons whose authentic identity does not conform unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female genders and assigned gender at birth. Male and female are increasingly being presented as two distinct states, with nothing between.
The ball has dropped, the champagne has popped and the partygoers have kissed. It's a new year. Now, it's time to think about your travel calendar. Before you know it, the planet will tilt and then you'll be roasting turkey and you don't want to think, \I never got to wear that harness.\ That would be tragic.
Yes, we are still on a journey toward making that dream of liberty and justice for all not just a pledge we make to our flag but a reality we live in our nation. And next week -- when same-sex couples start getting married in Florida -- we will be a little closer to that goal.



Nelson Moses Lassiter was excited about coming to terms with his sexuality. He imagined that, upon venturing out into the gay scene, he'd encounter a world more accepting than the one he was used to. What he discovered was not unlike the one he came from, though.


If journalism is a first draft of history, the movement for marriage equality deserves many more drafts quickly. While Solomon's Winning Marriage is rich, certainly there are other stories still to be told.
January is often the month when many of us feverishly start to fulfill or come up with what we want to change in our own lives in the coming year. We become a nation of wide-eyed idealists, hell-bent on doing more, becoming more and repairing the so-called chinks in our armor.
If men who have sex with men must be celibate for a year, then everyone else should be held to that standard too. If they can determine risk level for heterosexuals on a case-by-case basis, then they should do it for men who have sex with men as well. Assess the risk, test the blood, and treat everyone the same. It's really that simple.
I remember reading about his death, but he was misgendered in the original article.  I had no idea he was part of our community.
The region continues to be at the forefront of some of the most progressive lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) events in the world, often with the support from the United States.
I have been thinking about the word \unconditional\ a lot this year. As I delve deep into the issues of homeless LGBTQ youth, I often hear the youth say that what they are most missing are consistent adults in their lives, ones who can provide a safety net -- and unconditional support.
Now I truly understand, I am 'counterculture' simply because I live my life on my own terms. I am punk rock because I don't let the opinions of others police my interests.


The Supreme Court will decide shortly whether to review and decide a marriage equality case before its current term ends in June. Many are praying for this, eager to wrap up an issue long past the tipping point that folks are sick of discussing. But there is a more important reason the Court should act now.


As a drag queen, I play with gender roles and this has led me to develop a great respect for my transgender brothers and sisters who are not playing at anything, but are simply being who they were born to be.










Previously, any gay man who ever had sex with another man, no matter how \safe\ the sex, was deemed too risky to donate blood. Now they are banned only if they had sex within the last year. These regulations were put into place during the height of the HIV/AIDS hysteria.
The secret to staying together is staying together, but more than that it is caring enough to see the world through someone else's eyes and saying, I see you. Not just the bluster or hubris, but the soft core inside that is oftentimes hidden from the harshness of the world. I see you.
In my talk with David and Ashton I gathered that they are looking to create programs that are not only entertaining but will also educate people on some of the difference that make up or world. The two of them decided to create a production company catered to that.


It might be useful to remember what other threats to religious liberty have actually existed in the \history of our existence as a nation.\
The resounding international LGBTI-affirming commitments in the communique are a direct result of strong U.S. Government support to organize as inclusive a convening as possible.
I've been asked many times before if I fear that my son will \change his mind.\ What if he \decides he wants to be a girl again\? What if I made a mistake by allowing him to transition at such a young age? I know that without walking a mile in my shoes, it's hard to understand. So let's pretend my child wasn't born to be transgender.





What's more annoying than the constant ringing of bells by Salvation Army donation-bucket volunteers during the holiday season? The organization's longstanding, outspoken homophobia, of course!
Danny was never able to forget what it meant to be a homeless teen. He overcame homelessness and built a good life for himself, but he bore the scars in his psyche, and in his body. He contracted hepatitis while he was homeless; it shortened his life.
Once I recognized my passion for interesting characters and continuing storylines, an idea was born
At the same time, events like the ones in Ferguson, Staten Island and Cleveland, and the responses to them dominate the news. All of these things remind us of the truth that anytime anyone is treated less than equal because of who they are, we are diminished as people.


What tests my patience, what troubles me beyond all else, is our propensity for pointing the finger at others while ignoring our own flaws. The truth is that the U.S. is not yet at a point where it can self-righteously condemn others for their intolerance toward LGBT people, at least not with a straight face. Someday we will get there, and we will lead by example. But not today.
On 9/11, after the towers fell to ash, I headed toward the New York Blood Center. I faced one of the most acute moral quandaries I've yet to confront
After viewing his sermon and interview, in honor of Pastor Steven L. Anderson, I made donations to a center here in New York City that provides assistance to homeless LGBT youths, and to an organization that delivers meals to people living with HIV/AIDS, cancer and other serious illnesses.
In truth, of course, no one deserves first-class treatment more than the men and women, like Paula, who have given so much to our country. And they certainly shouldn't have to wait until they're dead - or even longer than that - to be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
We verily hope, pray and believe that the Professor Leonard's bold assertion that same-sex marriage will become the law of the land next year will come to pass. It is my prediction that Professor Leonard is right. The United States of America will finally recognize that love transcends gender.
In the second episode of The Pearl of Africa, I take you deeper into Cleo and Nelson's life, showing something that's rarely highlighted when talking about transgender people in Uganda

The recent mid-term elections marked a blazingly clear reversal of fortune for the Democrat and Republican political agendas. What's less obvious is how the reverberations will affect the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender) movement.
As we achieve rights, safety, opportunity, and status, will we forget ourselves? Will we forget where we came from? The \u202a#\u200eBlackLivesMatter\u202c uprising is an incredible moment for us to define who we really are.
Federal Judge Carlton W. Reeves in his eloquent opinion striking down Mississippi's marriage equality ban noted William Faulkner's famous observation

As I've observed my own behaviors and those of my peers, friends, and acquaintances, I've become increasingly certain that the gay community is no longer a true community at all but a hierarchy of cliques and labels.
Not long ago, sports -- including big-time wrestling -- were less accommodating for gay competitors. Only recently have most pro athletes remained active in their chosen careers after coming out.




Hate crime laws punish discriminatory violence, but they cannot begin the important work of preventing it. Only we can, by speaking for the multitude that suffers every day in America from bigotry.
When Charlie Poulson began his gender transition in college, his transition was followed with great interest by the people in small-town Ames, Iowa. Everyone knew he was transgender. But then he went on a trip to Rome.
This year, young LGBTQ adults who still lack health insurance have another chance to sign up and reap the benefits of coverage. Some of those benefits include free HIV screenings, depression screenings, well-woman visits and preventive services such as pap tests and mammograms.
I've been asked to write about my own journey as a gay woman who is an out-and-proud trans ally, and I feel not brave but kind of useless. Let me explain.
The doctor didn't expect to find what he found. It wasn't ovarian cancer but it certainly was everywhere. Her biopsy went to the cancer board -- you know, the one filled with the \experts\ who would try to figure out what we were dealing with.
The Other Show demonstrates the amount of queer creativity centered in Atlanta. There are a lot of divas who make it to our stages, but only the fiercest survive. With a devoted following, a rising diva in the form of Violet Chachki, and a creative no-rules ethos, this is the place to see drag in Atlanta.



For my graduate research I interviewed \Bernie\ and other lesbians about their lives in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s. Their stories have haunted me since. These stories, and the experiences of gay men, bisexuals, and transgender people told to me by friends and friends of friends, are woven throughout my first novel, Blackmail, My Love.
Being that it is summer in Australia at Christmastime Courtney regaled us with tales of dreaming of a white Christmas Down Under -- and holiday hilarity soon ensued.
In the age of digital dating your online persona can make or break you. With as much as 70 percent of gay couples now meeting online, it's difficult to argue the importance of your online persona. Mountains of revealing personal information is available to any potential love interest with a just few simple keystrokes.



My last relationship was a gay, polyamorous, open, interracial threesome. (I know, very 2013.) In a time when gay couples are becoming remarkably mainstream, we were \destroying the sanctity of gay marriage,\ I would often joke. Some didn't find it funny.
Marriage could be coming to Florida sooner than we expected. Plus, after last week's big win, the Mississippi lawsuit is now on the fast track to an appeal. And Kansas just lost their latest attempt to hold back the start of marriage.
As mayor, Mr. Park halted the enactment of Seoul's Charter of Human Rights for the city's upcoming observance of Human Rights Day. Why? The Charter included a provision stating support for non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
The night Darren Wilson walked away from an indictment in the shooting death of Michael Brown, I was banned from one of my favorite social-media groups, a group for gay dads. It seems that this group was not the place to talk about race, policing and what happened in Ferguson.


I held my boyfriend's hand the other day. I caught it and held it until we reached the main gates of University College Cork, as I usually do on campus, only this time I didn't let go after we'd passed through. We moved along the Western Road, toward Washington Street, and as we reached the innards of Cork City, something strange lingered over me.
I'm not the type of person who likes to keep secrets. I grew up in a house where secrets floated in the air at all times, and I never liked to keep track of who knew what. But when I realized at the age of sixteen that I was a lesbian, I suddenly had my own secret to keep track of.
Recently a colleague put me in touch with Orie Givens IV, the host of Queer Minded, to discuss issues that may be encountered by LGBTQ people during the holidays. Here are potential scenarios that could apply to you as an LGBTQ person during the holidays.


We asked New Yorkers to finish the sentence, I can get married, but I still can't... and here's how some of them responded.
While a few still wage a lonely and wasteful fight against science and progress itself, it is time to acknowledge that we finally have the opportunity to move on from a monotonous, one-way conversation and use our new tools as catalysts for serious and much-needed change.
I am gay, so I was required to worship La Streisand when I signed up for my Gay Card. But now that Sen. Inhofe has opened my eyes to her devilry, I am disappointed in my diva. I feel safer knowing that the senator may take over the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
I've been aware of Studmuffin NYC by Kyle Brincefield for a while, and I've been seeing his brand blow up this year. He was kind enough to hang out with me for a while, so I ended up with far more interview than space allows. Please check out the slideshow to learn more about all the things Kyle is working on right now.
I can barely remember a time before AIDS. I graduated high school in May 1981 at age 17. The day after graduation, I moved to Indianapolis to escape both farm life and parents unable to handle an out son. When I got there, I was shocked not only to discover so many others like me.
Surely everyone reading this is well aware of the issues surrounding the LGBT bill in Uganda. And as the world leapt to its feet, passionately denouncing this one bill in this one country, I waited for that same outrage to be directed at all the other places where this is happening in equal measure. I'm still waiting.




For decades, the country has approached the HIV/AIDS epidemic focused on individual behavioral risk. But, research shows that is only one part of the equation.
Our community is still struggling with how to communicate about HIV and how to treat those who are HIV positive. This is especially evident in the way we are accustomed to asking guys to disclose HIV status online, which has remained largely unchanged since the advent of profile-based websites over 20 years ago.




Why is Western society so obsessed with pulling people into certain categories? In an era when sexuality is increasingly understood to be a fluid spectrum, why must we assume that any non-oppressive society must have its fair share of \out-of-the-closet\ homosexuals?


It's a cold day indeed when you find yourself huddled against what used to be the Rawhide bar, bitterly surveying a vanilla-speckled permafrost of banks and franchises and chain stores. Is it not enough that the pharmacies and Starbucks outnumber the sex shops and watering holes, and have for quite some time?

On Sunday last week I had an opportunity to indulge my other passion, acting, with a reading of Spring at the Willowbrook Inn. I know for many it was quite a jump to see me go from Olympic diver to actor, and yes, I have seen many an eye roll -- \Oh, not another one!\ -- but performing is where it all began for me.

You are going to be rejected. It is true, and it is going to happen eventually. Someone is going to shut you down before they get to know you because you are living with HIV. It sucks, it isn't fair, and there is nothing that you can do about how they feel. But you can stop equating rejection with loss.
This week I talked with Justin Luke Zirilli about his new book, The Gay Gospel, a survival guide written specifically for 20-something gay men that tackles dating, sex, breakups, family issues, personal finance and more.
Mike was a mensch.  He was the wittiest man I ever broke bread with, and he was a quiet philanthropist who saved lives while he was influencing \the American century.\  He improved the quality of life of countless men and women, many of whom died, but many of whom, gratefully, live on.
Some people have been asking if there will be a second season. Stay tuned! It might be better than a second season. In the meantime please enjoy these clips of me laughing at everything.

The other day my friend and I were talking about the ridiculous notion that being gay is a choice rather than a biological disposition.  He asked, \What man would choose to be gay?  Being straight is so much easier!\ I thought about it for a moment. Is it?


Now, this may seem a bit extreme in support of a dead poet but maybe you are not familiar with Constantine P. Cavafy.  The translations of his words are timeless.





When you travel, sometimes it's not so much about the place you travel to but the people you meet. And sometimes the people you meet can be a little... out there.
I don't spend a lot of time with my family in general. I think the main reason is that I'm the crazy-progressive-political relative, but part of it is that I'm a lesbian -- one who doesn't blend and pass quietly as an unmarried lady with a lady roommate who happens to come along to family events. Few people are overtly rude, but the expectation that I not make waves is very strong.


The film Heartland is not your typical coming out film. It's important that movies start transcending to places where central characters just happen to be gay, it isn't the central theme of the story, it's just a fact.





The U.N. General Assembly's main committee dealing with human rights adopted an updated version of a biannual resolution to demand justice for all killings based on discriminatory grounds, including murders motivated by a person's real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.
I've been following Cleo's life up close for 18 months, and we're still shooting. I even moved in with Cleo and her straight boyfriend, Nelson, during one of my trips to Kampala, getting to know them both as human beings and as friends. Having been forced to live apart only to find each other once again in a foreign country, their love story is a true inspiration.
During a benefit being put on by an LGBT watering hole in the city of Greensboro, North Carolina, organizers learned that Steve had succumbed to complications from the brutal attack he endured a week before. Found naked, beaten, robbed and set on fire, the gay Iraq War veteran spent the last week fighting for and ultimately losing his life.

Technology is a danger of the contemporary dating landscape. I don't have it all figured out, but I have developed the \Donovan Rule:\ No frequent calling or texting before the first meeting - and no overnight bags on Date 1.


While this is only a beginning in studying this issue, it seems clear that giving people their rights and allowing them to participate fully in society, particularly economic society, is beneficial to countries.


By now, many of you may have seen the headlines or read news about what sounds like encouraging results, announced in late October, about two clinical trials of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) in gay and bisexual men.

Heightened judicial review of governmental discrimination against LGBT people would establish constitutional protections for LGBT Americans with respect not just to marriage, but also to any way in which the government discriminated against us based on sexual orientation or gender identity.





I am the fortunate parent who lives in awe of her 15-year-old child, whose courage and conviction to live authentically in a largely unfamiliar and often less-than-friendly world is humbling. And as she has grown into herself, so too have those around her.

There are certain rules in our dating culture that even though never formally stated, still somehow become ingrained within us all. To spare you the pain of making the same mistake that I recently did... added to this tacit list of romantic do's and don't's should be another decree. Thou shalt never meet a gym crush.



Organizations like FIFA and the country of Qatar take away from the true spirit of the sport through their discrimination. Discriminating over one's sexual preference is uncalled for in any and all circumstances. It's common sense that homosexuals are no better or worse than anyone else, and should be left alone to live life on their own terms.
I would like to return to the post that generated the most debate and heat, \Burying the Lede

I see you at 17 -- feathered hair, parachute pants, asymmetrical smile. You have just graduated from high school. Despite your outward ebullience, I see that, beneath the jocular fa\u00e7ade, you are so very sad.  Of this you are (mostly) unaware.
Funny what a difference time can make in one's life. When I first came out of the closet 20 plus years ago, marriage really wasn't something I was concerned about or even really interested in.
The award-winning Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina is many things to many people. For some, including me, he is simply one of the most imaginative and gifted writers at work today. For others, and again I include myself in this list, he is a pan-African cultural hero.

It's one of the most common statements we hear when a young adult first contacts the Hetrick-Martin Institute, the nation's oldest and largest nonprofit organization that provides life-saving services to at-risk LGBTQ youth ages 13 to 24. In fact, about 80 percent of HMI youth are homeless or lack secure housing, most often because of family rejection for identifying as LGBTQ.


I spent years faking interest in football, baseball, and basketball and pretending Adam Sandler movies were funny and getting shot with a paintball was enjoyable. If you could have branded me with a label on my forehead that let the world know I was in fact manly, I would have begged you to do it. Though never once did I ask myself what being a man actually meant to me.
I was orphaned when my mother Millie died nine years ago. My biological mother went back to being a Jehovah's Witness and now says she regrets being with Millie for 20-some-odd years. \Les di un mal ejemplo,\ she says. That's B.S. See, Millie is the one who loved me -- tender, unconditional, I-believe-in-you love.





In recent months, for a variety of media outlets, I've been thrilled to interview people about why they love my hometown of Palm Springs, California, hence the headline, \P.S., I Love You Because...\
Besides struggling to accept themselves, which is hard enough, transgender individuals face higher rates of suicide, homelessness, addiction and discrimination. And when it comes to getting help for substance abuse issues, trans people face a unique set of challenges.


Despite studies proving otherwise, some people still insist that children are being ruined by this type of family dynamic. They deem homosexual couples as \unfit\parents, but don't seem to have concrete or legitimate evidence to substantiate their claims.
My generation has been force-fed the notion that to be loved, to be special, to be something or somebody, one has to be a star. And I bought into it with certainty. From the moment I understood my reflection was I and I he, a star was born.

Having same-sex marriage legalized one year prior gave us hope that our bill would be heard and eventually passed; if our legislators approved marriage equality, surely they would advocate for the restriction of a practice that treats homosexuality as a curable disorder.

To keep up appearances -- and New York is a city of appearances -- one must always compete, and sex is simply another leg to have up on the other guy. Literally and figuratively. The competitive nature of New York is what drew me here, inspiring me to better myself in the pursuit of being the best. But the best what? What am I fighting for here but the preservation of my vanity?
Until one year ago we were perceived as an ordinary family when it came to composition
I feared being alienated when deciding to come out, but instead I felt welcomed. The overwhelming support from WWE, my fellow WWE Superstars and Divas, and my fans has been fantastic. This positive outpouring has eclipsed any negativity, and I only wish I had known that earlier.



Eight years, eight cities
I recently came across a piece by a black gay man who seems to need a bit of help when it comes to realizing how awesome he is, so I've come up with 10 reasons it's utterly amazing and pretty awesome to be a black gay guy.
Saved by the Bell taught me absolutely nothing about gender transition, but co-creating and producing Bayside! The Musical! has taught me to take big leaps of faith, learn from my mistakes, and believe in myself -- all the tools I needed to come out as transgender several months ago.
It strikes me that he would be pissed and proud that I wrote this post. He may have had a good life, but I mourn the fact that he was never really free. I feel the echo of his frustration and rage, and the ferocity of his commitment and love. I am haunted by him still.
Since puberty I've experienced gender dysphoria but developed coping mechanisms to ignore it. It got harder with age. Having just turned 33 and returned from another month-long tour, I felt more depressed than ever. With every single performance the pain of the lie was perpetuated.
Cook makes no apology for being gay. In fact he calls it \God's greatest gift\ because it made him more empathetic. But he is neither militant about it, nor defensive. It's not his cross to bear. That actually has a resonance that we are unused to in coming out narratives.


Sure, we've grown accustomed to celebrities coming out, some with great fanfare. But businesspeople? It's a rarity. Big businesspeople like Tim Cook? Hardly ever at all. In fact, just a short time ago, BP CEO John Browne resigned for fear of being \outed.\ That was 2007. My, how times have changed!

Apple has an impressively large and well-organized segment of out employees -- most of the major tech companies do, in fact -- and I bet they are all walking a bit taller and prouder today. We have a long way to achieve that level playing field, but that \sunlit path toward justice\ Tim refers to just got much, much brighter.


When I heard that Koko Jones, Houston's former percussionist (as well as The Isley Brothers' former percussionist), had embarked on her first album since coming out as a trans woman, I took notice and became very excited to talk to her about her life and music.

Whether at school or in public spaces, many LGBT youth don't feel safe and continue to face disgraceful levels of discrimination (and some don't feel safe at home, either). But when they enter the workforce, disadvantages persist.








There are a number of complicated perspectives and positions on trans inclusion in women's spaces, and these dialogues illustrate some of the complexities of combating patriarchy.
You might be one of the 18 people who decide not to vote, and that decision could make the difference between electing a pro-LGBT senator or one who doesn't support our issues. Every vote counts on the floor of the Senate, and losing that one vote could mean the difference between passing laws that further equal rights and being left high and dry as second-class citizens.
While midterm elections are not as sexy as the ones in which we get to pick a president, here are five reasons why the LGBT community should not sit out this year.
I've seen a little too much insistence this week, online and on social media, that Michael Sam's being cut from the Dallas Cowboys' practice squad had nothing to do with his being gay. It's a bit overwrought and defensive. A lot of fans seem to want to believe the NFL is not a homophobic institution.



I want our government to accurately count us because it gives us power, tells us how to make life better for our community, and gives us hope. We need to know that we're one of many. I will press the Census Bureau to help us prove that, by adding questions to the census and other surveys about sexual orientation and gender identity.

In the third episode of Go-Go Boy Interrupted, Danny tries to take his mind off his job trouble with his version of meditation
Over the past two weeks, community members in L.A. have held a vigils to mourn the death and celebrate the life of Aniya Parker.  The murder of Ms. Parker marked the eighth homicide of a transgender woman of color reported in the U.S. since June.  She was shot in the head and killed as she was fleeing from three men who had confronted her on a sidewalk in Hollywood.
The collection, aptly titled \Slut Goes To The Moon,\ was futuristic with a tinge of luxe, geometric shocked in electricity, plus bold everything. Slut really did plan for a trip to the moon, but she might have met a nice, handsome fella to settle down with along the way.
I will always be grateful for allies, no matter if they're huge celebrities or small town citizens. But making some lavish yet empty promise does nothing but tarnish your word. Do something, otherwise, I hope your marital vows last longer than the ones you made to the LGBTQ community.









Dr. Gloria I. Joseph has a treasure trove of memories of the renowned Audre Lorde, her late partner. Joseph's long-awaited new book, The Wind Is Spirit

The conservative media's meltdown over a Nebraska school district's effort to train teachers about gender diversity demonstrates how conservative misinformation threatens even basic efforts to protect transgender and gender non-conforming students.

That Ebola now compels other Americans to consider the threat of a contagious virus suggests how fortunate they have been. Instead of sounding off an alarm of hysteria, they might just want to listen to how the other half lives.
Just as the church asked if they are capable of welcoming us without compromising their doctrine on the family and matrimony, so too must we ask if we are capable of allowing them this opportunity for reflection and growth without compromising our own strength and knowledge that we are not flawed beings and that we do not require their affirmation to affirm ourselves.


By letting this decision, and others like it, stand, the Supreme Court seems to be recognizing the amazingly swift turnaround in public attitudes on the issue of same-sex marriage and on gay and lesbian rights, in general.
I had no idea what I would be as an adult because I didn't see anybody I could be. What I would have given to hear a high school teacher say, \I'm gay,\ \I'm a lesbian,\ \I'm queer;\ to tell me that I could grow up to be a person a young man would respect?
The movie is about four teenage girls who each grow up feeling different -- simultaneously special and rejected -- as so many LGBT teens have experienced.
On November 14, 2008, Dwight DeLee fired a shotgun at close range at my two children. Both were hit and both were wounded. My son, Mark, overcame his injury and shock enough to drive my daughter, Lateisha, to our home to get help.
Although over half of the French favor legalization and almost two thirds have a positive image of gestational surrogates (women who carry other women's embryos), France's political leadership attempts to distract its public from economic malaise by demonizing surrogacy. The latest missive comes from Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
Every year toward the end of September, as my teeth sink into the crystallized outer shell of the season's first striated melocreme, I hop into my confectionary time machine and find myself whisked back to 10 happy days in Montana.
Today, as I walked the midway with my family, I felt grateful for all that Tracie and I have experienced in our thirteen years, grateful that, despite the newness of our separation, we could come together as a family, in peace.

While civil unrest continues to pervade the east of Ukraine, a new generation of artists and musicians in Kiev are creating wide spectrum of sounds and spectacles.  At the forefront of this burgeoning scene is Lyudska Podoba (Human Shape).
If we only work on behalf on the \right\ kinds of women, it diminishes the movement and repeats mistakes of the past, where feminism was not nearly intersectional enough. Beyond a concept of simple solidarity, though, is that many of the core issues of feminists and transgender people are the same.
Episode 2 of Go-Go Boy Interrupted shows what happens after a night of heavy binge drinking causes Danny to struggle to remember who the man in his bed is. And then the worst person who could drop by for a visit does.

I can always tell when a guy that I am about to hang out (read
As confirmation of her lifetime of success, Mariah will be honored by The Center in Palm Springs with its first ever \Legacy Award\ to recognize exceptional work on behalf of LGBT people living in the Coachella Valley.

The Emmy-nominated actress recently made history when she became the first transgender person to grace the cover of Time magazine in May of 2014.
The Feminine Mystique didn't give me any makeup tips, it gave me a new map, a new consciousness to explore. It felt like a miracle when Betty Freidan landed in my mailbox, leading me back to school at a time where 'Women and Madness' electrified classrooms.



Even after 16 years, the name and story of Matthew Shepard, whose murder, carved into American history, represented a watershed moment that forever changed the conversation about the LGBT experience, not only still resonate but continue to have an impact.
More distressing than the profound lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS among the 431 adult men who participated in the survey is the fact that it reveals a startling failure -- even an absence -- of HIV education among gay and bisexual men, despite the fact that we account for the nation's highest number of those living with or at risk for HIV.

Upon coming out publicly in May 2010, I thought that that would be last time I would ever have to come out. Boy, was I wrong. Since then I have had to come out again and again. But last week I found myself in a coming-out situation that I had never experienced before, and I wasn't sure what to do.
I think about Harvey's impassioned plea quite often. It whispers in my brain with both inspiration and reservation -- inspiration because, as an out woman, I have experienced what only coming out will teach you, and reservation because, as a Christian, I also know that coming out and purging all secrets can be a dangerous, painful prospect.


Abby took her girlfriend home to Minneapolis over Labor Day weekend, and, at the insistence of her father, her girlfriend joined them for the family lunch with Grandpa. After an awkward beginning, with Grandpa not knowing who Abby's surprise guest was, Abby's dad stepped in and began the conversation.

Being gay is a unique experience. Being Native American is a unique experience. And being a gay Native person who has been able to thrive and survive and is brave enough to share a personal story of coming out in this cutthroat world is nothing short of remarkable.

For the first time ever, there is a database where people can see exactly what is happening to transgender people globally in terms of violent acts against them. The TVTP was launched earlier this year in the hope of accumulating as much data as possible in order to serve as a true resource and, ultimately, to put a stop to such acts.
As far as equal rights have come in the last few years, up to a third of LGBTQ people are still subjected to \conversion therapy,\ among the most damaging forms of psychological abuse a person can endure. Conversion therapy encompasses a range of dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.
Do not sit back complacently. We have won one battle, but there are others that we must engage in.
Break down some myths. Destroy some lies and distortions. And if we do it long enough and loud enough and together enough eventually we will be done.
\You have to stand your ground and be who you are and find acceptance -- if not in others, than in yourself. That's the road to happiness...and as Oscar Wilde said, and is quoted by [the character] Lola
Stories offering a white, affluent, gay, male-centric perspective have hit the street running. The term 'Truvada whore' is already an early soundbite from mainstream media. But don't be fooled. The first voices may be the loudest, but they are not the most important.

This should be cause for celebration. We will have finally won our rights. And yet, I am melancholy. I am grateful, but I am not satisfied. I have this nagging, gnawing question



Both climate crisis denial and the anti-vaccination movement follow the same trend of dismissing science. But the phenomenon of religious and political science denial extends far beyond the obvious examples. It can get much worse, and much uglier.
In the midst of all life's uncertainties, we must create space that allows our youth -- especially LGBT youth -- to thrive so that they are able to reach their full potential.
Is Laverne Cox HIV positive or HIV negative?  She tells us, and explains why disclosure is uncomfortable for her, reminding us that stigma around HIV/AIDS leads people to assume a transgender woman of color must be HIV positive.





Stanlake is a beautiful, androgynous teenager living on a dangerous and desolate council estate in South London with his mother, Poppy. They're both recently arrived immigrants in the UK.


Earlier this month hemlines were high at Col\u00e9gio Pedro II in Brazil. After seeing their transgender classmate Maria Muniz get suspended for wearing a skirt to school, the boys and girls of the school all wore skirts to show their support.
Of course before I could suggest this tool for gay dating to a client, I figured I better do my homework.
I wrote  I Am Harvey Milk for you. I wrote it for anyone who has ever had to hide or keep secret their true nature. I wrote it for me so that I might get a step closer to understanding my own gay life, my own gay wounds, my own gay joys.
It's the film's inclusion of both a male sex worker character and a young child that's making some uncomfortable, although Blane is quick to point out that there is no remote connection between the two in terms of sexual situations or scenes.





I won't love them despite their sexuality, and I won't love them because of it. I will love them; simply because they're sweet, and funny, and caring, and smart, and kind, and stubborn, and flawed, and original, and beautiful... and mine.

As gay and bisexual men, it can be overwhelming -- and in some cases, downright exhausting -- to keep HIV at the front of our minds and on the tip of our tongues. But talking about it, with a friend, a doctor or a potential partner, can ease our anxieties and potentially change our thinking and our actions for the better.


Forgive me if I'm not popping the champagne. In reality, this is nothing more than a publicity ploy to quiet critics some of whom, by all accounts, are buying it hook, line and sinker.

Martine and I discuss transistioning, being grateful for our lives when so many others are no longer here, and being authentic to yourself and your soul. Martine expresses a gratitude of life when so many transgenders have fallen along the way.
Two books of photographs reflect a new vision of gay life, one looking forward, the other back. Both boggle the mind with what they reveal about the changing com\u00e9die humaine of gender and same-sex love.
I wish I had known Joan Rivers. Something about her always intrigued me. At 22 years old, I sit here writing this on a quiet plane back to New York, laughing hysterically to myself.


Friends and family became concerned as I was slowly wasting away, but the attention I received from my man and the boys in the bars more than made up for their worries and validated the importance of being skinny.
Who'd of thunk, that 3.5 days at summer camp in the Catskills, freezing my booty off with a bunch of like-minded, awesome, \let's be friends first and talk about business later\ peeps, could lead to a reunion between my younger and present day self. Guess I came out again!






My oldest son is now in the fourth grade, and he's never had an incident of anti-gay bullying at school. And that may have lulled me into a false sense of security, because I was caught totally off guard when it happened to his little brother.
I questioned why I continued to stay. Was it habit? Some sadistic sense of comfort? Did I think we'd change back into the people we once were? I'm not a weak person. I grew up in such a loving home. My parents have a beautiful marriage. What's wrong with me?
George Ashiotis started going blind when he was 5 years old. When he was a teenager, he worked at Lighthouse as an assistant counselor, helping younger visually impaired teens. After helping his sister dye her hair black, he ended up going to work with black fingernails, leading to his first experience of homophobia.


Take some time to get to know the local communities who have been building bridges, winning and losing campaigns, and making a difference for generations. Enter these communities with humility and a beginner's mind. And please, please don't erase the rich history and culture of the queer South just because you finally started paying attention.
For LGBT inclusion in particular, policy alone doesn't drive culture
Formerly of Coyote Grace, Joe is one of the first openly transgender performers to contribute to the alt-Americana/alt-indie folk music scene. I spoke with him about his perspective on Pittsburgh, his queer identity and his relationship with the dyke community, and his music.
It's been a long road to marriage equality, and it seems we're still only halfway there. For the last two decades I've been on another fulfilling journey with our community. It's made fewer headlines than our fight for marriage rights, but it's been so important for so many families just now finding that legal recognition.

During the spring semester of 2002, while I was teaching my creative-writing class at Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn, a student finally shared and read aloud a poem that he had just written. And after he read, our jaws dropped with amazement, our eyes widened with shock, our brows curled with concern, our hearts stopped with empathy, and our bodies froze with fear.
In a reported effort to enforce safety rules that insist that all users indicate their legal name, Facebook may have put Sister Roma, and potentially thousands of other drag performers, at risk while inadvertently igniting a firestorm that is sweeping across the LGBT community.
As I have entered into my \Drewliciously Dirty Thirties\ I have begun to realize that I can be sexy, not in spite of my disability, but because of my disability.



Last Thursday at the Southern Comfort Conference in Atlanta, HRC President Chad Griffin apologized for all the problems between HRC and the trans community for which HRC had been responsible over the years. He was specific and demanded to be held accountable. These are words the trans community has never heard before from HRC, certainly not in public.
Sure, the human body is beautiful. But let's not kid ourselves, our naughty bits are some crazy looking parts. It's time we got comfortable with them and stopped treating the whole sex thing with so much fear. It's sex for goodness sake. Subtle Dildo certainly does all of those things.

The indie film stars Judith Chapman, Max Adler, and Danny Mooney. Chapman plays Maggie, the mother of Drew (played by Adler), who is gay and goes on an adventure to convert homosexuals into heterosexuals in order to raise money to help pay for his mom's cancer treatments.
'You don't tell your friends at daycare you have two dads?' 'No!' I had no idea how to respond. Ever since our kids were born, we've tried to help them understand and be proud of the fact that their family looks a bit different than others.
My ground rules were simple - I would talk to anyone whose face, not their crotch, appeared in the frame. With my heart rate raised, I moseyed on over to Chatroulette.com and hit \Start.\
From being labelled as having a disorder to shouldering the burden of some of the highest rates of violence and HIV infection in the world, the perils of daily life for transgender people are multi-layered and can inflict substantial harm, experts and activists say.
Maybe puberty only happens once physiologically, and maybe no matter how hard I try I can't make lyrics from Dashboard Confessional or The Spill Canvas resonate the way they did in 2006, but I do know that I am starting to see what it means to be a person of faith who takes ownership of what they believe.



Ultra-creep and man of the cloth (of course!) Mark Driscoll went on an online rampage on a church chat board in 2000, and that sh*t has resurfaced and man is it crazy. Not regular, old crazy; full-on \bat sh*t, hold on to your hat, papa's got a brand new bag\ crazy.

In this \Digitally Speaking\ segment, I discuss the social media impact produced by these notes, and how they can help parents everywhere better handle the coming out moment for LGBT kids.
Thank goodness that instead of listening to my doubting inner cynic I began to stack things in my favor by believing, being optimistic and trusting that my path was my true path and I would thrive.
If Westboro does show up in front of our offices to protest, we'll be ready for them. We're not scared of a handful of sad people with access to school supplies and a few nasty slogans.
Court victories aside, the newlyweds' detractors provided a focused snapshot that the road to marriage equality is not without its speed bumps -- and its opponents not without their loud voices.
It is hard to stay calm when we read about transgender violence, and we continue to experience discrimination in our community's. It hard to be patient when our children's self-esteem is being eroded in ways most parents cannot fathom.

By reducing my fat intake to zero and running for an hour at a time, I knew that I'd destroy every fat cell that existed in my body. I had commenced an all-out attack on the demon inside me that made me feel that way



I never met Joan Rivers; I always wanted to, but never had that special opportunity to meet her.  Yet, I didn't have to meet her in person to be inspired by her.  As a gay man, I always understood her humor and struggles.


It's heartening that Michael Sam's signing is being seen as a football decision not just by Cowboys leadership but by a majority of fans as well. And by looking beyond the SEC All-American's sexuality and simply giving him a chance to play, the Dallas Cowboys have proven that they truly deserve to be called \America's Team.\


Way too many people seem to think it's funny, or even impossible, for a man to be raped. I'm not sure that it matches the indifference with which we view the rape of women, but the reactions are still disturbing. Too often they even come from gay men, who are ourselves disproportionately subject to sexual violence.
If you make an informed decision to practice barebacking, then so be it. I can't say I will never do the same. However, short-term pleasure, a sense of belonging, and the excitement of abandoning homonormative sociosexual practices cannot be divorced from either a willful rejection of long-term health or a romanticized concept of what HIV infection leads to.
Lately we've seen a surge in films featuring gay characters whose sexuality feels refreshingly incidental to the plot. Post-gay movies can be love stories, dramas, or comedies, but what they all share is a recognition of gay people as part of the natural fabric of modern life.
Brandiilyne had just updated her Facebook page to vent about a 20-page paper she had just been assigned in school. In fact, she was completely overwhelmed with back to school and her many other ventures. She was so busy in fact, that she almost missed the most important Facebook post of her life.
Phil Robertson simply can't let it go. He keeps trying to explain his homophobic rant to GQ magazine, which might be partly to blame for the falling ratings for the hit reality show, Duck Dynasty.


However we respond to these types of questions, from children or adults, whether innocent or malicious, the one thing we need to keep in mind is this
I want to pass along a bit of advice about life. Because I'm a recent graduate, the triumphs and tribulations of senior year are still fresh in my mind, and with all the infinite wisdom that is conferred upon me by three months out of college, it's a big deal that I'm passing along my sage advice to you.

While the experiences of sexual and gender minorities during disasters are drawing increased attention from some responders, structural barriers remain and experts are urging a rethink of policies and protocols that could fuel exclusion.



What the hell are you doing here, anyway? OK, that's it. You need to get your ass home! You're fucking 40 years old! You've got kids! You have a wife! It's winter 2009. Just a few months ago everything changed when I acknowledged to my wife Evelyn that I'm gay.





Georgia Democrat Michelle Nunn is running in a competitive race for an open seat against Republican David Perdue. There is little doubt where Mr. Purdue stands on LGBT issues (strongly opposed), but there is a lot of doubt about where Ms. Nunn stands. And what to do about that is an issue Georgia's LGBT community is wrestling with today.


Outed by a French magazine in 1989 at age 55, Chamberlain spent another decade-plus side-stepping the subject. However, he admitted a pivotal point in accepting himself as a gay man came while writing his best-selling 2003 memoir.
The idea is that using healthy, sexual images in HIV messaging will dilute the fear of contracting the virus and further increase the risk of infection for my peers and the younger gay men on the up and up. On its face, this argument makes sense. But make no mistake

PrEP has magnificent potential to prevent infection. It has the potential to provide many with a chance at a more comfortable life, but I would encourage the gay population to be responsible and remember that none of us are invincible, no matter what powers we think we possess.


We were so heartened to hear that the National AIDS Memorial Grove had renamed their college-scholarship program the Pedro Zamora Young Leaders Scholarship. It is dedicated to continuing Pedro's legacy by supporting the academic efforts of emerging young leaders who share Pedro's passionate commitment to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

Yes, I've taken the time to write this as a mock break-up letter, but it comes after extensive research, including recent phone calls with both T-Mobile and AT&T, and I wanted you to benefit from what I've learned.
For years Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has worked to undermine the lives to gay and lesbian families, but now a judge has ruled that he's finally gone too far.

Being a good ally begins with listening and actually hearing what transgender people have to say about their lives. When people actually do listen, the results can be remarkable.
It's hard enough carving out a space for ourselves in a world that constantly marginalizes us and our very existence. And having strange men assume that we want to hear what they think of us when there are very few things we want less in the world just adds to the burden.



In her youth Elicia Gonzalez from Broomfield, Colorado, experienced a shocking exposure to Prince that would become \very much so representative of what would happen with my sexuality later in life.\

Over the years, the startling consistency of the manner in which I am addressed while he is ignored has become a quasi joke between us.


Michelle, I am appealing to you as one mother to another, but there is a difference


As a transgender woman I get asked by gays and lesbians quite frequently how the T fits in the LGBT, and why transgender rights should be part of the larger gay agenda. Rather than shrug off the question, I take the time to actually answer.




Bullying and taunting follow people through their entire lives, and it's not just a problem for our children. Just ask the drag queen who was brought to tears onstage during a late-night cabaret show in New York when discussing recent anonymous attacks against her on Secret. Who benefits from that?




We're not looking to have an elaborate wedding. Likely we'll show up, just the two of us, at a courthouse some 300 miles away. Imagine, my dear heterosexual friends, if this were you. I'm just going to guess you'd be a bit irritated.




Mandeep Jangi of Middlesex, New Jersey, cites his Sikh faith as the \more visible aspect\ of his identity. His decision to cut his hair (long hair is a traditional part of Sikh culture) was the first step to discovering his own individual identity.
None of my own experiences combined with what I know of my father's life make me think any less of a person who chooses suicide. In this week of unhappy reflection, I've found myself repeating that phrase a lot. Who are any of us to understand what pain another is going through, or to what depths?

Second-wave feminism included many lesbians who didn't know many trans women, because few were out and active in those circles in the '70s, and found it very easy to weave into their philosophy the absurd idea that trans women are \the avant-garde of the patriarchy's invasion of women's spaces.\
For years, I've been adamant about the advantages of an open relationship.  I've  seen monogamy as a viable choice -- but for others.  And, without resistance, for the first time in decades, I find myself giving myself fully to just one man.
In Entebbe on August 9, more than one hundred LGBT Ugandans celebrated the first Pride Uganda since the Constitutional Court overturned the draconian Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) for being passed without a quorum.
Folks are not familiar with issues around adoption and don't know the correct language to use unless they have been impacted by adoption or educated on the issues. Likewise with the LGBT community.

Paul Burston, the creator of the Polari Literary Salon in London, has, through sheer charm, hard work and diligence, transformed the possibilities of what a literary event should be

Ten years ago in May, 2004, Massachusetts had its first legal same-sex marriage. The ceremony was also the first of its kind to be held in the United States. My partner -- soon to be called my spouse -- and I were married a few months later.
The Supreme Court generally only hears a small handful of the petitions brought before it. But with so many major marriage rulings in the last year, they are virtually guaranteed to have one or more cases on their docket, with a ruling likely by June 2015.



Our community's problem isn't with MichFest. If it became trans-inclusive tomorrow, the underlying problem would remain. It isn't even with the antifeminist nature of the trans-exclusionary radical feminists; if they quieted down tomorrow, the underlying problem would remain. The problem is the iceberg below, which no one wants to recognize.
Personally, I don't believe my tax dollars should be used to pay the salary of someone who wants to convince the world that my ultimate desire is to be able to legally molest children.
My discussion with Kris is centered around trans equality now and the future.  We discuss the inequality still facing trans people, especially trans women of color, and how we as a community move forward to progress to full equality and being treated fairly without bias and discrimination.
This week I talked with filmmaker Alexia Kosmider about her new documentary, TransJourney, which follows Sandra on her cross-country journey to share in the life of her child, formerly her son, now her \new\ daughter Annabelle.
My first real-life, up-close glimpse of this insane standard for the gay male physique was at a bar in New Orleans. Although I did not want to use my minimum wage to stuff the dancers' G-strings, I envied their natural ability to grasp the attention of the room. I realized that beauty and a good body came with a lot of power.
In this episode of my podcast, Nicholas Snow Live, I welcome Top Rock cast members Brandon Alameda, Dani Armstrong and Victor Turpin, now in residence at the Hard Rock Hotel Palm Springs.
Do you remember your first Pride event? Kayleigh certainly does, along with the impact that participating in Dyke March with her family had on her life.
\Nervous and excited about this. I think a lot of people forget that this isn't just political posturing and ideological debate -- it's personal, it's my life and the lives of many I love!\
When people all around you are telling you directly that you have no claim to your womanhood and that by merely existing you are furthering the patriarchy, it cuts right through to your heart. I want to be able to return to the Land feeling welcome and safe. MichFest is my home too.
As lesbians and gays we are on the precipice of what could be called our largest wins ever. I am just struggling to understand both how and why we were able to divorce LGBT equality from a larger conversation about feminism, race and class in society.








All of those things that we believe to add value to our lives should only be applied to our lives for the sake of our own desire and love for them, not because of what we perceive someone else to desire from us.

When I packed up my Buick and headed off from Long Island to a small Christian college in rural Arkansas, it never dawned on me that one day I'd be performing comedy dressed in women's clothes while sharing the name of the world's greatest harlot.

What is the effect of the new, repressive anti-LGBT laws around the world? \We have evidence to show that the law is killing people.\

Sadly, her story is all too familiar. Too many children \rescued\ by the government from families unable to care for them are abandoned to caregivers who subject them to abuses more terrible than those prompting the state's intervention in the first place.
Is there an androgynous experience of a city? No? Then Barcelona has just invented it, perhaps not only for me. This should not be too surprising as this old, Spanish city ranks as number one in gay freedoms, nuptial rights included

Although such things are happening slowly but surely, will being queer continue to inhibit the likelihood of the first gay president?
At a recent protest rally on the streets of Boston, just one of many that I've seen personally, watched on TV and read about, members of our community went at each other's throats, demonstrating not only how we're not monolithic when it comes to passion and politics but how LGBTQs are inextricably tied to world events.








I've been thinking of my own early years as a queer youth
I'll be called out as a hetero-normative cisgender supporter of the patriarchy for saying this, but it would be nice if we could use English to talk about our issues. Maybe it's a bit quaint to advocate simplicity, but it seems to me that the LGBT elite have created an entirely new language made up of six syllable words.



With the growth of online niche porn, gay boys can now lust after men of all body types. We're in a pro-beard, anti-trim bubble right now for men, and I'm greatly enjoying it.
Even many of us affected personally went on with life, doing little to ameliorate the suffering of those we loved. My father's lover, Jim Cox, died of AIDS in 1991. Sweet Jim. He gave me ballet lessons each morning when I was living with my father on Sugar Loaf Key in 1986.
While it doesn't carry any legal weight, only the power of symbolism, the most touching moments for me in the president's presentation were his fluency with the word \transgender.\
Meth Head, a much-needed film, is riveting in its portrayal of the fast, destructive cycle of methamphetamine addiction.

Anyone who engages in risky sexual behavior should take extra precautions, be it through PrEP or otherwise. While I'm certain that the WHO acknowledges this, their message nevertheless helps perpetuate the falsehood of HIV being a \gay disease.\
despite so much progress in terms of the equality of gay people under the law, we have not seem the same kind of improvement in connection with the very issue that provoked the most recent wave of the LGBT movement in the first place -- the fight against HIV and AIDS.
Tobacco companies have long targeted our community with ads featuring LGBT people and themes. They have supported our causes. While the support has been welcomed, it has come with a price.

1. \Hey, you!  Have you had 'the surgery'?\ This is kind of like someone coming up to you and asking about your vagina or penis. No, wait, it's exactly like that.









I have a good sense of humor, but... can't you find something else to make us laugh? Why are we gays so amusing to the rest of you?
My friend Sam is a \confirmed bachelor,\ and I'm using air quotes as I write this. Years ago, before you could swing a dead cat in a Banana Republic without hitting an openly gay man (which I would not recommend), that was code for being gay.
Many of us have been bending our characters' genders and sexual orientations for years, but it's terrific to see the game officially embrace this.
We all can do better at deploying language, style and dance moves that has cultural attachments that are not our own in such a way that it feels inclusive. There is no one to one scale of oppression that allows any group to place a claim on another's culture even if they share aspects of the same identity.
Believe it or not, right now some Republicans are working feverishly to get support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in the GOP and try to pass it in the House in this session, with the dangerous religious exemption that caused LGBT groups to withdraw support. The irony here is off the charts.
If my gay colleagues choose to jettison ENDA, I'm willing to back off. But the question with which I am left is

I was with my wife for nearly 10 years before we were married the first time, we had two kids, and I never considered a prenuptial agreement, because I thought it would be forever.



As a society, we have just begun to talk about what it means to be transgender, and I, like most men of my generation, knew almost nothing. If there is anything that I've learned, it's that the subject is deeply complex. I think I understand something fundamental, but I really don't.

Did the World Health Organization (WHO) really declare that all gay men should take Pre-exposure Prophylaxis? With my social media feeds showing multiple articles with similar titles in such a short timeframe, I knew this was an issue that called for a response from GMHC.


I don't tell African-American women what to like and how to act, so please try to do the same for me. I think it's time that we celebrate each other and stop telling other groups what to like, how to act and what to do.
HIV care, treatment and research seem to be more often taking two steps forward with each step back. For the first few decades after HIV was isolated and characterized, we far too often took two steps backward with each step forward.

I want to see a large and vocal movement of allies who are standing alongside transgender people and helping to create a just world where members of trans and gender non-conforming communities no longer face stigma and violence and have the same opportunities as everyone else.



For the \Proud Whopper\ promotion to have been meaningful, Burger King should have gotten its own workplace practices in order before preaching equality to others.
Imagine driving through Starbucks to get your coffee while you're running errands for the day and sitting in line behind a mini-van with cartoon pictures of a five member family, and while reading your news feed on Facebook you find out you are no longer married.
Encountering the Family Research Council's Peter Sprigg in the D.C. Council Chambers on June 27 took me back five years to our battles over the District's marriage equality bill. This time it was a hearing on a bill to prohibit conversion therapy for minors.


\I might as well be invisible,\ I thought. I was sitting in my wheelchair in the locker room while the other kids played a sport in gym class. I could hear them and wondered how long it would take for anyone to find me. I felt so alone. I thought I was a burden to my family, and I felt hopeless.
Embracing LGBT employees isn't about sacrificing your values, it's simply about treating people like people, fairly and equitably.


This week I talked with writer/producer Gary Janetti about his groundbreaking new PBS sitcom Vicious, which tells the story of an older gay couple, played by Sir Derek Jacobi and Sir Ian McKellen, and their longtime circle of friends as they struggle to maintain their visibility and significance in our youth-oriented world.




When asked about the recent progress of Kenya's LGBT movement, Njeri Gateru doesn't hesitate to answer with the word \visibility.\ Ms. Gateru is one of 500 fellows taking part in the Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, the new flagship program of President Obama's Young African Leaders Initiative. IREX is pleased to share her story.
Savvy black trans woman Laverne Cox appeared on one of this summer's Chelsea Lately episodes, and I found myself not listening to Laverne's answers but analyzing the depth and careful placement of Chelsea Handler's questions. The restraint with which Handler handled herself was dripping with streetwise smarts.
For many of us, bottoming isn't an opportunity to enjoy a pleasurable sexual experience but an act that threatens our sense of masculinity and the respect that goes with it.
Gay people have to be courageous to accept ourselves, be honest about our feelings, and live our lives. I struggle with that courage every day, but when I read the bull**** that people say, I just want to stand tall with my chest puffed out and say, \I'm a homosexual and there ain't nothin' wrong with that!\
Michael, who is living with HIV, fled Nigeria two years ago after being beaten up and threatened with his life by anti-gay vigilantes. He was shunned by his family and was forced to live a life of exile in the US.
A 16-year-old transgender girl spent 77 days alone in a Connecticut prison without ever being convicted of, or even charged with, a crime. Known publicly as \Jane Doe\ because she is a minor, she sat alone in the York Correctional Institution, a high-security prison in Niantic, Connecticut, for two and a half months.
LGBT Pride Month has become more about paying lip service to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community than it is about addressing the real issues that affect us. It is a token gesture, implying that everyone can ignore our issues for the other 11 months of the year.
During dinner, my aunt handed us a folded piece of paper containing an email she had received from the senior pastor of the Meridian Street United Methodist Church, Anne Rosebrock. I quickly read the email and was greatly impressed by the powerful message it contained.



As I celebrated Gay Pride this past weekend with family and friends, I couldn't help but notice a completely different feeling in the air compared to prior Pride weekends.

President Obama has the opportunity to solidify his legacy by creating a clear vision for full federal LGBTQ equality. LGBTQ people in too many places in the United States live under the overwhelming weight of oppression.


In the past year I've increasingly been made aware of the growing meaning the word \tranny\ has taken on for members of the transgender community. For the most part I have gotten a pass because of what Trannyshack is, but still it nagged at me. What was really the catalyst for me deciding that I had to consider a change was when I came across a post on Facebook.

While the work of the LGBTQ movement is far from done, Pride Month is a great opportunity for the LGBTQ community to reflect on just how far we've come in a relatively short period of time.


I wasn't expecting to get a reality check from a place that sounds like it came out of a Dr. Seuss book.




A famous quotation widely attributed to Gandhi has been on my mind a lot lately

There are loads of white gay celebrities who are quite open and willing to engage in discussion. The disparity between out white and out black public figures is quite bothersome.
One year ago today, in two historic decisions, the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the so-called \Defense of Marriage Act\ in Windsor v. United States. In an instant, the world changed forever.



I have spoken with many people who feel that a Pride parade in the Midwest probably features a tightknit group of folks from the local LGBTQ community only -- and that it's sure to draw groups of angry protestors. That was certainly not the case at Circle City IN Pride Festival 2014 in Indianapolis.


As I started receiving attendant care and being made to wear pee bags (for my own freedom, they claimed -- really?), I noticed that my ability and desire to freely \whip it out,\ as it were, had waned with my loss of privacy. Now there were all these barriers to self-love.
Recently, on one of my long walks, I asked myself, \What if we started from scratch and redefined 'health and wellness' in a way that is fad-proof and could withstand the test of time without dictating regular changes in diet, exercise and outfits? What would that look like?\ Then a friend sent me a link to Ms. Fit.
Gay acceptance has reached new heights if 49-year-old, recently married gay men are one of Playboy's \preferred demographics.\
It's time for girls' and women's institutions to move from reactivity to well-considered policy. Fundamentally, women's colleges were founded on the premise that women could, and should, think.
I would like to propose that when we see each other, when we greet each other, when we congratulate or debate each other, we do it all with great kindness; that no matter what we believe to be true or not true about words and the meanings behind them, we refuse to use any form of language that might be even remotely jarring to someone's spirit.
Over the years, I've heard a lot of explanations from people who want to defend the use of this word beginning with 'gringos don't understand -- it's cultural.'
Scary as it might seem to break the Windex shine on the windows of our lives, often, that breakage is the exact medicine we need to catapult our lives into a new realm of inner peace, happiness and self-awareness in order to achieve the ultimate \AL\ -- Authentic Life!
While Kerry gushed about the State Department's accomplishments for LGBT people and reminded us to be active instead of alarmed at the growing global anti-gay trend, the embassies he leads were turning down visas for LGBTI Africans to attend San Francisco Pride 2014.





As we pull ourselves back up and wipe off the loss, we are held up by those before us who took to the streets that fateful night at Stonewall and refused to remain victims. We are leap years closer to equal rights because of their brave sweat and tears and we carry on the fight in their honor.


At what moment did gay men throw up their hands and say, \This isn't my community anymore! I'm stepping away. Moving away. I don't belong here anymore\? I ask because I hear that often.
As for so many of my friends who were present to listen to the president, all the aspects of my life seemed to have come together to help produce positive change. The education, advocacy, community service and political lobbying and maneuvering all have that one goal

Lost in all the online coverage of President Obama's speech at the DNC LGBT Gala this week in New York -- with his powerful words on the AIDS crisis and his announcement that he would sign an executive order barring federal contractors from firing us -- was a challenge to our community that few noticed.
Homophobia is the thing tearing families apart, inspiring physical abuse, and leading to death. Homophobia is the disease, and it appears to be the one with which you, Governor, are afflicted

A year ago, I nervously boarded a flight from Kennedy airport in New York to Portland, Oregon. I would be attending the LGBT Sports Coalition's Summit hosted by Nike. Over 50 leaders in the LGBT sports world would embrace me and change my life forever.

For anyone under 30, it may be difficult to imagine a time when the gay-rights movement wasn't operating at a milestone-a-minute pace. Fortunately a wave of artistic and media projects has emerged to remind us of heroes past, to refocus us on the type of activism that helped elevate the LGBT movement and to inspire us to make that final push.
The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf was published in 1936, just before the Spanish Civil War. Because it was widely viewed as pacifist propaganda, it was banned in many countries.

Because I don't have 0-percent body fat, and, from what I keep reading, that is the purpose of Pride. And those who tell us it has nothing to do with body fat, and that we need to stop obsessing over unattainable physical-perfection goals, tend to possess unattainable physical perfection.
I ran for a legislative seat here in Oregon and lost. But during the endorsement process I gained an interesting insight into politics
He's a British blue-eyed soul singer who is anything but the norm, not because of his sexuality (which he has yet to officially define by hanging a label on it) or his physical appearance but because his rise seems to have been imported from another era when stars were born, not manufactured.
When Ryan Kendall, a young gay man living in Denver, heard the news back in 2008 that the Califor\u00adnia Supreme Court had ruled in fa\u00advor of the freedom to marry, he reached out to us, and we soon learned that, as a 14-year-old boy, he had survived brutal so-called \conversion\ therapy to change his sexual orientation.
I have long thought that LGBT can be seen as the proverbial \canary in the mine shaft,\ since in places where individuals, institutions, and entire societies marginalize, commit violence against, and deny basic human rights to LGBT people, other social groups face similar adverse treatment as well.
All across the nation, tens of thousands will gather some time in June for annual gay pride parades and festivities. TV cameras easily capture dancing go-go boys and prancing gender illusionists.
John Glines, the producer who won the 1983 Tony Award for Best Play (Torch Song Trilogy), explains how he came to produce the show and take it to Broadway in this extensive interview on my podcast.





Let's celebrate what makes gay dads unique, as well as what makes them as equally awesome as all the other active, engaged and loving fathers out there.
Jane asked her supporters to share this representation of her so you can see her as the person that those of us who know her best do
We know the world is changing. Gay marriage is gaining support in households as well as in courts and legislatures, but there's still the fundamental problem that coming out as a gay man puts you in a minority community with majority parents.




If you had told me in 1991, when funerals were as much a part of my social life as fraternity parties had been a year earlier, that someday I would be helping men with HIV have babies of their own, I would have laughed in your face. But that's exactly what I am doing today.
The Normal Heart may have educated us on how events unfolded when the virus first became known but, as one of the world's leading nonprofit organizations, amfAR celebrates its success in funding more than 3,300 grants to researchers around the world working to find a cure.
When I became a cheerleader, my father said, \Why don't you just shoot me now? I told your mother, 'Get him a toy gun and a Bowie knife,' but no, she just had to get you that damn yellow stuffed bear!\ In my mother's defense, I was 5, and the bear was jonquil, not yellow.

As marginalized people, we are pushing the boundaries unwilling any longer to accept the repressive status quo. In coalition with other disenfranchised groups and allies, we are refusing to buckle under and to assimilate into a corrupt system.
So I'm curious, Dad. If we could find peace over our differences about my homosexuality, what might be different in our relationship? How would our relationship improve? What else might we discover we really like about each other?
Meeting Justin Utley is like catching up with one of your closest friends, as his calm-but-confident energy puts you instantly at ease. I met him in Dublin, a day after his flight from New York to start off his Irish and UK tour. His musical beginnings are not like most other touring Americans who travel abroad.

We can't expect to get appropriate care from our health providers if we don't come out to them. Conversely, our providers have to be well-versed in the healthcare needs of LGBT people. Aside from our romantic partners, our providers are the people who most need to be aware of our gender identity, sexuality, and sexual behavior.
When news circulated that the notorious Westboro Baptist Church was planning to protest the \home-going\ service of our nation's most beloved citizen, poet, author, civil-rights activist, and sister sage to us all, Dr. Maya Angelou, there was a collective gasp of disbelief.
Ever since I came out, it seems I've always had at least one friend who is way hotter than I am.  Here are my observations of this sometimes annoying relationship dynamic.






Along came Anita Bryant with her Save Our Children crusade and enough was enough. This kid, steeped in Bible-believing, conservative fundamentalism, sat down and wrote a letter to the newspaper denouncing Bryant's intolerance. To say the least, it was noticed.



It would be nice, for once, if actual transgender people were given a platform to actually say that we exist, on our own terms. It would be refreshing if there was an acknowledgment that fixing the problems we face is going to take more than pride and proclaiming that we exist.

I am pretty certain that if you read the title of this post on its face, it sounds like I have written an amazing 80s pop ballad about how I loved a man, but he couldn't love me because of my disability, and so I couldn't allow him back in my heart.
In an era with sex on our fingertips, literally just a swipe away, we have seen an increase of beauty culture that has required Adonis-type bodies to be deemed attractive in the queer community.

When I get married and have kids myself someday, I'll be trying to live up to what my parents taught me
Thanks to Jane Lynch and the open lesbian character she played when she was a freshman, I too can look back at that thespian moment in my life and see it for what it was




People say I was dealing with adults who had the capacity to know better. And, most bruising to my ego, they tell me that my seductive charms were irrelevant, and that perhaps it was the adults who were doing the manipulating.


Getting to gay has not been easy. Everyone that knows accepts who I am, but I still struggle.  Everyone around me believes everything is going to be fine.  Why can't I?




I'd like to invite all bloggers, LGBTQ and allies, to participate in the ninth annual Blogging for LGBTQ Families Day on Monday, June 2. Just post at your own blog in support of LGBTQ families (however you define them) and submit the link to mombian.com, where I'll compile and showcase the master list for all to see.




The Normal Heart remembers moments, then reinvents others, and it reminds me that AIDS fiction is not the truth but a reflection on the emotional truth of an epidemic. That's all I ask for. Lie to me about the look of a lesion and I will forgive you. Lie to me about the emotional truth of the epidemic and I'll pitch you out like an old AZT bottle.
Determinations of what medical treatments are covered by Medicare are made mostly by regional decision-making bodies, but there is a small number of national rules -- called NCDs -- regarding whether certain treatments are covered by Medicare. In 1981, HHS issued an NCD that Medicare does not cover transition-related health care.
Sister Luciana cursed. She took me by the hair, which was blonde and curly, looked me in the eyes and shouted

We must find a way to understand the damage we do. We can't continue to throw around words that we don't find personally offensive and wash our hands of the harm they cause to someone else. If we do anything less than put an end to the use of anti-trans* slurs, then we are just bullies.


I was prepared for a big cry-fest when I watched the HBO film, The Normal Heart, but I didn't shed tears. Instead, I felt a deep profound feeling in my gut that challenged my own attitudes towards what I allow to hold me back. I asked Matt Bomer what lessons he learned from helping tell this story.
We need more leadership from the top, as we had when the President came out for marriage equality and lit a fire under the movement and the party.


It's been less than a week since Bianca del Rio was crowned America's Next Drag Superstar and her dance card is full of appearances, from New York to Mississippi to Alabama, and that's just in the last week of May. But, Bianca has her eyes set on bigger stages and silver screens.




Don't discuss \your gays\ like nail polish or Tamagotchis. Don't \collect\ gay friends, though they may add mounds of platonic goodness to that drab life of yours. Gay friends are not your personal magical, well-dressed accessories.

Don't wait another second. You can recover from a lot of things -- a lost job, people in your life who react badly, discrimination, and much more -- but the one thing you can never get back is your youth. Spend it being who you are, not running away from it.





Catholic doctrine states that homosexual acts are \intrinsically disordered.\  As I came to a more mature awareness of my homosexuality, there were always people claiming that they learned love from Christ, yet they built a wall between gays and Jesus.



\What do you want us to grab, honey?\ my mom asks me on the phone. There's a fire raging towards my house. I'm not there. Someone else has to help me. \What do you want us to grab, honey?\





I am incredibly proud of the fact that Cambridge made the decision to issue marriage licenses in the first moments of May 17, 2004. The cheering crowds on the front lawn still echo through the years. In the decade since that incredible night, the spirit of tolerance and equality has been slowly, steadily sweeping over this nation.
The Dallas Principles were an effort to codify, in a manifesto of sorts, the values with which the LGBT community could most effectively move forward. I think we did a good job at expressing our beliefs and putting them into language that could be embraced by the community at large. Let's take them one by one.
It's been 10 years since same-sex marriage was legalized in Massachusetts. So, precisely what are the results of this deregulation? Anti-gay activists predicted disaster for \the family,\ but were always quite vague about how.
On the morning of June 28, 1969, a raid was tried at the Stonewall Inn. It wasn't a gay bar -- there were none. It was owned by the mafia, and was a place for all outcasts, including drag queens, butch lesbians, feminine boys and male prostitutes.
Whether it's new funding for monitoring coverage of LGBT issues or incorporating LGBT awareness in current media development initiatives around the world, we can make it so that the stories of LGBT individuals and communities are told with the accuracy and dignity that all people deserve.
As quickly as those words entered my ears, I became the boy  in the chair. Immediately an outsider in a group that was supposed to embrace outsiders.
Tyunique Nelson was struggling with parts of her life. Through her struggles she found some peace with Alex, a new person she met at school.

As the world gears up for HBO's The Normal Heart, I present a recent episode of SnowbizNow in which standout films in 30 years of AIDS in cinema are honored.
Having met more young people, I'm seeing sexual orientation as far more fluid than I once thought, and often not about sex at all. Indeed, when I hold my husband, the end goal is not always climax but comfort, adoration, reassurance, and so much more.
\My family's always been very supportive of me. I came out to my family when I was 14, but I wouldn't really consider it a coming out; I just confirmed it. I've been a feminine boy forever. It was good they already realized.\
This week I talked with filmmaker K. Rocco Shields about her multiple-award-winning viral short Love Is All You Need?, which is about to become a full-length feature film. The concept of the film follows the life of an ordinary heterosexual girl who is bullied in a world where everyone is gay.
For everyone's sake, it's long past time to stop claiming that right-wing Christian revulsion in response to same-sex romantic love has anything to do with the Bible. Nothing in scriptures prohibits a kiss between two men.
I am all for people appreciating Michael Sam's achievements, but there is no need to denigrate femme gay men and further femmephobia to do it. Femmephobia is a serious problem inside and outside the gay community.
Bearded Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst's epic victory in this year's Eurovision competition sent a clear and powerful message to all the homophobes, and anti-LGBT factions in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.
I've started engaging homophobes in deep conversation, looking for the reasons, spoken and unspoken, that they feel this total incomprehension, disgust and dislike when it comes to gay people, especially gay men. My findings have led me to a sort of classification of homophobia into seven (often overlapping) types.
I'm still a radical, political queer and Kristyne is still a conservative, Catholic girl, and I am so happy that we were able to work together, despite our differences, to produce EastSiders.
It was my relationship with a former partner that finally prompted me, in my 30s, to come out to my parents. And it was that relationship that finally led me to bring a man home to meet my parents. It turns out that I did not give my mom and dad enough credit.
The fact that I have never barebacked speaks more toward my emotional flaws than some enlightened sexual ethic I possess. If I were a better gay man, I would have had a boyfriend by now who I loved enough to bareback with.
As a child, I was raised by one parent who was a charter subscriber to Ms. magazine and spent weekends in the bachelor pad of another who collected (also from its first issue) Playboy. Perhaps it is no wonder then that today I am a professor of gender and sexuality studies,
Football fans realize that draft decisions are nuanced -- an art and a science. And that's exactly why Sam's poor draft showing should disappoint those who hoped and expected better from the NFL on draft day. Sam's on-field performance speaks volumes.







Being a parent can sometimes seem like trying to juggle on a roller coaster. Being an LGBT parent can sometimes seem like trying to do so without the safety belt everyone else is wearing. But the experience is really not so different for any of us. It takes balance, flexibility, and nerves of steel.
At the end of this month, the Von Bs are joining forces with several friends and businesses for an event to benefit Michael Morones, the 11-year-old My Little Pony fan who was bullied so severely that he attempted suicide. All the planning has gotten me thinking about bullying and how it has affected me personally.
I think my husband is doing a great job of teaching them what it means to be a man. My sons learn from him that men are strong, smart, silly and creative. But what am I teaching our sons about what it means to be a woman? My sons learn from me that women are strong, smart, silly and creative.
Gay doesn't actually mean stupid, and attempting to redefine a word that is meant to describe a minority group to mean \stupid\ is a micro-aggression towards the LGBT community.


The tag line for the game is \Your friends. Your drama. Your life.\ It should probably follow that up with \So long as you're heterosexual.\

It was the first time that I didn't think about having -- or not having -- a drink. I lost myself in the joy of that matinee performance and the exuberance of the performers who were happy to be alive despite -- or because of -- the years of baggage behind them.
Three years ago the world and I lost Thomas Lee Bridegroom. Tom loved me like no one ever had. He taught me to love myself and reminded me every day that I was worthy of my own love and the love of others. His absence has been felt each and every day of these past three years.




For those of us lucky enough to exercise control over our own bodies, we are also free to label our so-called 'loss,' despite the archaic definitions you will still find in dictionaries.

Brazil has a reputation as a sex-positive country. But Kelvin explains that when it comes to homosexuality, Brazilian families might not be as liberal as you'd think.
It's a normal and deeply human need we have to nurture the next generations. It's not exclusive to heterosexuals. Judging from my own experience, it's not even necessary to want children of your own to feel this desire to \pass on\ and share what you have learned.
People need privacy. We need our own little secrets, our hot steamy affairs, our dirty chats with perfect strangers. It helps keep life in balance. But a relationship needs trust and openness. Keeping secrets on your cellphone is too easy.
Youtube hasn't just brought ROSWEGLYN together as friends, but it also has brought a whole new community along with it where acceptance is key.
I have spent most of my adult life distancing myself from my Jewish identity.  On many levels this isn't that surprising


Sometimes it's tricky explaining America to an 8-year-old. When our daughter was that age, the trick was explaining marriage. Now it's our son James who's turned 8. This time the America I find myself having to explain is the Boy Scouts of America.
Calling me a boy implies that I am either immature or some kind of sexual plaything, and not at the same intellectual level as a man. There's a demeaning hierarchy in motion.

You're going to be my child and I'm going to love you forever. Everything I am working for in my life right now is so you could be proud of me.
You don't have to wear a white sheet with a pointy hat and go around burning crosses to be racist. We all harbor prejudices of some kind, and many people are carelessly and casually racist while being perfectly pleasant otherwise. As I see it, racism and homophobia are two sides of the same coin.
For the girls I loved before I knew that's what I was doing, I promise to blaze a trail of queer wherever I can. I'll do it for Amanda, for Ana and for Kelly, and for every person who fears their love is something lesser than love.

I am still a fan of those in our community who are so punk rock that they have adopted certain loaded words to self-identify. Rock on, darlings! Just remember that there are indeed still prejudices and still impressionable minds who hear and see everything going on.
As LGBT youth, adults and families know all too well, bullying isn't confined to just the playground, classroom, or cafeteria -- it can happen to anyone, anywhere. And as my wife and I prepare for the birth of our first child, we have to learn when negative actions become a teaching moment.

Before season 6 of RuPaul's Drag Race concludes with its annual coronation of a new winner crowned by RuPaul himself, I thought I would check in to see which queen is winning the social media drag race.
We've come a long way since our lives and experiences were deemed illegal and we were forced to remain in the closet or else be subject to arrest, but we have a ways to go before we can claim true equality under the law.
Rabbi Yanklowitz states that we should \do what is right not what is popular.\ So is the rabbi the civil rights freedom fighter of the 1950's or is he the one in agreement with the movement in the 1970's?

What I love about the way this couple is planning their wedding is that they treat the event like it is very special, but it is not an end in itself. They see that there are many more great things that will transpire in their lifetimes.



I asked my youngest son, Matthew, who is 15, to watch the This Week segment with me. His only reaction was to snort dismissively when Graham spoke about gay parents and adoption. \What does he know?\
Getting a meaningful job seems unattainable right now. I can't change things that are beyond my control. I can't change the fact that I'm 52, and that I'm transsexual with a voice like a guy.

Fighting amongst ourselves does nothing to advance the discussion and bring greater clarity to ending HIV. MIchael Weinstein's comments  about Truvada being a \party drug\ may have been flippant and imprecise, but in that sense he is no guiltier than those who flatly promote PrEP as \90- to 99-percent effective\ without clarifying that such rates of risk reduction are hypothetical.




Sometimes, I wake up in a cold sweat thinking about a lost moment of activism, of resistance, of assertion of lesbians' words in Ann Arbor. I think of the ways I have failed lesbians and lesbian culture.

The statement, titled \Freedom to Marry, Freedom to Dissent,\ desperately tries to revive the lie that Eich was targeted and toppled by LGBT activists -- a victim of \left-liberal\ \intolerance,\ as Andrew Sullivan so ridiculously claimed.

In honor of Mother Nature, and in celebration of Earth Day and Month, 2014, here is my new poem, which also honors the precious life of Marius, the young giraffe who was senselessly killed at the Copenhagen Zoo.
Living from a place of fully loving every part of yourself, especially when confronted head-on with the haters, is not only the path to a deep spiritual awakening; it is exactly what Jesus faced on His own prophesied path.
It's called a one-night stand because it's only supposed to be a short moment of your life, something you can just walk away from and maybe brag to your friends about. But if it changes you and leaves you with scars, can you still call it a one-night stand?

The political establishment of Iran is not known for its open-mindedness or tolerance on sexuality and gender. Nonetheless, its homophobic vitriol has been exceptionally high these past few weeks.
At this point, there has been so much confusing Affordable Care Act news coverage that many people in Oregon (and across the land) have developed ACA fatigue just from having to hear about it around the clock -- myself included.
My hope and prayer is for the church to fully embrace all LGBTQI people. This will have a dramatic impact for many, but most especially for our youth, who do not need to be shamed, \healed\ or merely tolerated but fully embraced and loved just as they are, beautifully created in God's image.





These days when Selena Blake thinks about her native land, Jamaica, there are no images of pristine beaches and sunny skies that come to mind. Instead, she sees the ugly face of homophobia and transphobia that continues to stain Jamaica's image.
Why do some marriages need to be qualified and explained?

The battle for acceptance is not solely taking place in the courts, but also at playgrounds, little league games, chess tournaments and in churches, synagogues, mosques, everywhere LGBT families are quietly going about the business of raising children and living their lives.
Eight months ago I pulled a bra out of the washing machine for the first time since breaking up with my college girlfriend and loudly coming out of the closet as a gay man a decade earlier.

Perhaps the reason bi celebrities may be reluctant to come out is that they fear it would hurt their careers in a way that being gay no longer does.

For the transgender individual whose misrepresentative outer appearance is at the root of their personal conflict, it may be clear how the skin is a critical component of establishing self-harmony. However, the role of the dermatologist in their care is yet to be determined.
The conspicuous absence of any openly LGBT nominees to the other federal appellate courts is a concern. It cannot be the case that no qualified LGBT candidates exist. Instead, the dearth appears to rest on the assumption that LGBT judges would not be appropriate because of some apparent bias.

Fifteen years ago we were in Fort Collins, Colo., at the hospital with Matt, praying for a peaceful end to his suffering. At that point we were aware that he would never wake up from the coma he was in as a result of the beating that he'd received at the hands of then-unknown assailants.
Did I lose you with the \gay\ bit? Let me explain. Love it or hate it, since time immemorial, there is likely one guy or gal out of every 10 who is gay. Lots of former Olympians compete in Gay Games. And -- finally getting to the point -- lots of gays compete in the Olympics.
I would recommend Southern Decadence for several reasons, but visitors' ability to either relax and take it slow or party as hard as they want for as long as they want (hello, 24-hour bars!) makes this weekend an ideal destination.

I recently corresponded with a young lesbian of color, age 27, who has never had a gynecological exam. I couldn't fathom why. When I asked her, she replied that she doesn't have sex with men, so there is no need. I have to say that I was shocked.

I told the students I have been with my partner Janis for 13 years, and that we have three young children. I never mentioned my transition or used the words \lesbian\ or \transgender.\ I just let them draw their own conclusions. Then I asked if I might do an audience participation exercise.
Can we have a conversation about the word \tranny\? It's a word that is generally considered dehumanizing and offensive when referring to transgender people. But there it was in headlines last week in the story about DJ Mister Cee. There it was in a Daily Beast interview with Jared Leto.
It is remarkable how little has been done to dispel myths about HIV-positive people. Changing these perceptions is one key to wiping out HIV. Meanwhile, the HIV-positive community, now numbering almost 2 million in the U.S., continues to grow every year by 50,000 people.
Severe pain in my 17-year-old son's abdomen took us to the ER last week. It's one of those situations that everyone dreads, but if you're transgender, there can be an added level of anxiety when the medical professionals aren't current on trans health care. Such was the case for us.
Macy v. Holder established that gender identity is protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. While encouraging, reliance on the Civil Rights Act doesn't offer transgender individuals the protection necessary to close some of the employment and wage gaps they so frequently face.

This sort of policy only ends up forcing students, especially trans students, into living situations where they are harassed and must be on guard at all moments. This further alienates already at-risk populations of youth when we should be including these individuals and building them up.
In 1938 a Sicilian mayor did the local homosexuals an inadvertent favor, and all in the name of currying favor with Mussolini. Anxious to appear as fascist as possible, the mayor of Catania rounded up 45 guys and shipped them to the lovely island of San Domino in the Adriatic Sea.

Although the pope did not suddenly change the church's view that LGBTQ people should remain celibate, whether as priests or as lay people, he did tell Christians around the world that it's time to live up to the highest values of the faith rather than descend to base disrespect for human beings.
Realizing I was gay in Russia felt like a terminal disease diagnosis. There I was, a secret pedik, one of the monsters I'd heard about so much yet knew so little about. Convinced that I was the only real gay person in Russia, I felt completely alienated from the human race.

When Splash does close this month, I won't necessarily miss it (though I did have some remarkable times there).  What I will miss is the New York City that it was a part of, a place where the fringes of our culture could come together and celebrate.
For the most part, my life as a trans woman seems to be working. But I truly cannot go back to living as a man. This is a choice like breathing is a choice. I can choose to not breathe, but not for long. I have to do this to stay alive. Truly I do.
I'm not the first or only guy to be a dad.  Or a single dad.  Or even a single gay dad.  I don't think there's that many of us, but I'm not one of a kind.  Nevertheless, I am different from almost everyone I'm close with, including the gay couples I know with children.

Really?  Argle-bargle?  The term doesn't appear in my dictionary, but I take it to mean an incoherent ramble, the equivalent of gibberish.  And to apply it to the legal arguments that a generation of lawyers and legal scholars have debated for years is, itself, offensive.
Despite the fact that full LGBT equality has not yet been achieved, the trend towards achievement of that goal is definitely clear.

Sometimes life will give you lemons. And sometimes you make lemonade. My lemonade came in the form of a Yorkie puppy. This is our story.
Imagine waking in the morning and entering into a play. You assume the part of a character who is not you. The character is about 5 years old and male. \How can I play the part of a boy?\ you ask. \This is the part you are assigned,\ comes the answer.
We had intended to be somewhat tongue-in-cheek about our marriage. In the hours leading up to the \I do,\ we kept trying the word \wife\ on for size, and then guffawing at the absurdity of how it sounded. But before we knew it, romance had crept in.
The kids want to fish. Damn. I'm going to have to dig for worms. I hate worms. They're icky. But the dad I'm aspiring to be doesn't say words like \icky.\ Why can't I be more like those other kinds of dads? Wait. Is this just internalized homophobia? Probably. So what am I saying?
The immigration debate gets to the heart of a conversation about who is a \real\ citizen, who is part of our communities, and who can be allowed to stay and live here, and who has to do so through a shadow existence, with no basic rights. Sound familiar? If you're LGBTQ, it should.
In an example of how one might avoid these types of labels, Paul Scalia referred to homosexuality as a \phenomenon\ in a
8 Life-Changing Images Of Love In Turbulent Times Whether we're gay, straight or bisexual, we all crave love in our lives

On Aug. 17, in cities across the world, major photo shoots will be taking place to create powerful images in which people proclaim what they will do to make equality go viral. I was honored to have some of the organizers of the \I Am Equality\ campaign on SnowbizNow.
On the steps of the Supreme Court, we began to sing the national anthem. I'm amazed by how incredible it feels to sing this. It's a powerful thing to hear a host of men's voices blending together, marginalized citizens showing pride in and passion for a country slow to embrace them fully.
After the historic moments that went down last week, what better way to celebrate Independence Day than looking into America's
Do the increasing acceptance of homosexuality and the recent Supreme Court rulings mean that anti-LGBT prejudice is on the way out? Not exactly. Just like racism and sexism are alive and well in 2013, I suspect the same will be true for heterosexism several decades from now.

Last week, HUD released its first-ever study of housing discrimination against same-sex couples. News outlets picked up the study, reporting preferential treatment for heterosexual couples over same-sex coupes, but they deeply mischaracterized they study's findings.
Rather than argue that my film is persecuting them, evangelicals should speak out against violence and intolerance. I encourage evangelical Christian leaders to embrace the heroes of my film, who are in fact faith leaders who are spreading a Christian message.
As we celebrate Pride Month and the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising by LGBT bar patrons fighting back against the police, who were trying violently to arrest them, I wonder why more liberals and progressives don't seek to learn about a fascinating ancient theology called Gnosticism.
I knew the Supreme Court rulings were to be made that day, but nonetheless, I found myself utterly awestruck, which is not easy to come by for this queen! Before calling family, posting to Facebook or tweeting to my fans, I found myself recalling the very first time I went to a gay bar.
The contrast between the American and British ways of arguing over family values has never been more visible than over the past few days.
It's hard to sum up just how incredible this week has been
Marriage is a means for rich people to consolidate and concentrate their wealth, one of many ways to enforce the status quo. That the Supreme Court justices' decision comes at a time when families are being eviscerated by the wealthy should give progressives some pause.
We made this video because we believe that the real victory in DOMA and Prop 8 being struck down is the victory of thousands of LGBTQ people and our allies who have changed the culture of this country, not just its policies and laws.
While I'll certainly benefit from this change in policy, for bi-national GLBT couples, DOMA's repeal not only legalizes their relationships, but also makes them able to legally live in the same country together. Even immigration reform would not have had this impact on GLBT immigrants.
\Oh say does that star-spangled flag of pride yet wave,\ she crooned to the roaring delight of those gathered. Celebrating
My discomfort in watching the joyous reactions to recent gains for marriage equality stems from my understanding of the Stonewall rebellion as an impetus for revolutionary change within an oppressive social structure, as opposed to mere reform, accommodation, or assimilation.
For us, it's the end of a long, long journey. Well, it's not really the end until Karin gets her green card. But it's the last hurdle for us. And it's the green light that so many have waited for to get married and established together in America.
The Sermon on the Mount presents a radically different agenda than what the nation of Israel expected from the Messiah. Our Supreme Court Justices overturned conventional wisdom in their ruling, and this is what Jesus did every day.

To get the fagbug to Hawaii and Alaska, I went carless for 54 days, flew on 14 planes, had the car shipped (on a boat) four times, rode with it on a ferry for four nights without a cabin to sleep in, and interviewed people in seven different languages (including sign language).
I am thrilled with the great strides forward that the Supreme Court has helped the gay and lesbian community achieve. But I feel as if Brian and I are on a different boat. Others are partying onshore, and the party looks fabulous, darling, but we are waiting for our boat to take us to shore.
Being queer means constantly questioning what's considered \normal\ and why that norm gets privileged over other ways of being. It means criticizing who sets these norms and recognizing the privilege that comes with being able to identify as \normal.\

The challenges LGBT people face in America won't simply dematerialize as we achieve each new policy objective. Passing good laws and enacting good policies is hard work, but changing culture is much harder.
How did we get here? It's been a long, winding road, starting with the passage of Prop 8 in 2008, and then the stunning announcement that David Boies and Ted Olson were teaming up to fight it, and then one victory after another, but still no resumption of marriage.
I spend too much time and money  on DOMA, my personal and community enemy since I met my wife in 2005. Because of DOMA, my life has been turned upside down, my pockets turned inside out, my future blurred. DOMA has made me do some things that no American should have to do.
The video is really a reminder that Gay Pride isn't simply about drink tickets, covers charges, and body image. As a matter of fact, for many in our LGBT family, the party atmosphere is downright life-threatening.
In honor of LGBT Pride Month, we wanted to take a little walk down LGBT history lane to explore the origins of Pride, and take a closer look at those electrifying evenings in June when the LGBT community decided to stop hiding and start fighting.
The next time you feel tempted to turn to pedophilia, polygamy, and bestiality as a go-to argument against marriage equality, I want you to repeat the words \two consenting adults\ to yourself 10 times, and then find another argument.

I wonder what LGBT pride looks like in areas heavily influenced by religion, or areas so isolated from queer culture that the nearest gay bar is two hours away. These are questions that will take photographer Christian Hendricks below the Mason-Dixon Line for a six-week journey this August.
Though I cannot adequately apologize for the sloppy theology and biblical illiteracy inflicted on so many LGBT people, I can stand with others of faith and try to convey the experience and grace that God loves us more than we can possibly imagine.
The same methods historically used by the government to imprison and pathologize homosexuality and gender variation are being used today to justify the extreme marginalization, lifetime institutionalization, and oppression of people who have violated sex laws.
Still clutching my wad of soggy Kleenex, I sit in the overflow ward of the emergency room while Patrick's body is prepared for the coroner.

I'm well aware of the misogyny and homophobia of hip-hop as a whole and the fact that Azealia's male counterparts say similar things on wax and outside the studio, but I'm specifically irritated and baffled by Azealia's ignorance, behavior and theories because she's a black bisexual woman.

Today we celebrate a man. A humble man, but an inspired man. A beaten man, but a brave man. A pragmatic man, but hopeful man. As we celebrate, however, I worry that, were he still alive today, he would be saddened by our nation's tolerance of exclusion and injustice.

The National Cathedral is the second largest cathedral in the country, and it's been dubbed by Congress as the \National House of Prayer.\  It's a symbol of Christian faith in America.  And now it lets the gays marry. If that's not a step toward equality, I don't know what is.

NO American needs an semi automatic fire arm. These guns have nothing to do the 2nd Amendment. They were not invented yet! As Lillian Hellman once said \I will not cut my consonance to fit this years fashions\. Meaning, don't make things up so you can have a semi automatic fire arm!

Given the AP Stylebook's decision to discourage the use of the word \homophobia\ by journalists, I thought it might be interesting to take a look at \heterosexism,\ what it does and doesn't mean, and why it (along with \anti-gay\) cannot exactly replace \homophobia.\

Social stigma, whether it be homophobia in the world at large or HIV-related stigma within the gay community, limits our ability to tackle HIV/AIDS at all levels. This holds particularly true for LGBT Americans. Too often the LGBT community itself has reinforced AIDS-related stigma.
As we observe World AIDS Day, I find it perplexing that few seem willing to embrace or even mention the epidemic that so greatly affected and altered the LGBT community. What is it about that era that frightens us so?

Dr. Gary Gates has reported that 50 percent of people who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual identify as bisexual. He's also reported that 3.5 percent of the U.S. adult population identifies as LGB. Detractors seem to feel that the latter percentage is too low and the former too high.

This Memorial Day I'll pause and honor the many of my own troops who have fallen in battle.  They may not have had the uniform or the recognition of our armed forces, but the wars they fought were just as valiant, and I, for one, am richer for their many, varied gifts and sacrifices.
Gay culture is one of the most ageist cultures in America. As a result, older gay men are targets of some of the worst online vitriol from other gay men.   Many older men have to get \creative\ when listing their ages or risk being unattractive to younger guys.
While I understand that this is a natural response to the passage of such a discriminatory act, one that targets innocent North Carolinians for the worst of reasons, misunderstanding and bigotry, I'm asking everyone to take a deep breath.

I had no idea that transgender people could live so openly in Indonesia, a country with the world's largest Muslim population. Like many Americans I had this notion of Islam as being particularly unforgiving toward sexual minorities. How could a community of warias possibly exist?
Though it's impressive that a mainstream television show centered on queer women has seen such success, the show's distorted depiction of lesbian culture is something to mourn, not celebrate. Young queers deserve positive, nuanced examples of lesbians in mainstream media.
We pride ourselves on knowing all kinds of Sapphic pop-culture facts. Each week we'll share some of the best tidbits on The Huffington Post in our new series, \Best Lesbian Week Ever.\ Here's who and what was on our raging gay radar this week.
Grindr not only helps intensify the sexualization of the user but also creates a divide between gay men. We have become more concerned with our phones than the people in front of our phones.
Dr. Samuel Pang is the Medical Director of the Reproductive Science Center of New England (RSC), a pioneer in helping lesbians and gay men become parents. I talked with Dr. Pang about these procedures and issues facing our LGBT community.
For gay men of a certain age, the passing of Donna Summer last week was a significant loss. Those of us in our late 40s and 50s remember this disco diva in her 1970s prime.  Upon hearing the news of her death, all the memories attached to that time have come flooding back.
A wildly insensitive New York Times article on the life and death of trans artist and drag performer Lorena Escalera flared tensions between the gender-variant community and the paper when it was published as part of the Sunday edition on May 14.
Voting rights are LGBT rights!  Elder rights are LGBT rights!  Economic rights are LGBT rights! The perfect storm of officials and movements coming together to support the American dream of equality is here.
I joined the struggle for LGBT equality because of the shared experience of injustice. No immediate member of my family is LGBT, and my sexual orientation is heterosexual, but if I claimed to embrace the words of Dr. King, I must live and act out the values of those words.
And as the old saying goes, \If 50 Cent is doing it, shouldn't we all be?\ So for all of you out there who still aren't convinced, here are my six reasons why you should be cool with gay marriage. I'm looking at you, Manny Pacquaio.
On May 22, 2012 a large crowd gathered at the corner of Center Street and what was formerly known as Blaine Ave., in San Diego, for the unveiling of the nation's first Harvey Milk Street, named for the first openly gay man ever elected to public office in the United States.
Ravi's Twitter posts, webcam spying, and homophobic attitude were stigmatizing, and it is possible that these pushed Clementi to a tipping point. But Clementi's suicide did not happen in a bubble with only him and Ravi; it took place in a society in which homophobia is still rampant.
What are we going to do about all of the \non-manly\ guys running around the United States? Apparently, the great assumption is that by engaging in activities ranging from military exercises to boy scouting, we could eliminate the \problem\ altogether.
The arc of history is long and bends toward progress, but it usually starts in a bad place. Former congressman Chris Bell knows this, because he went through his own reevaluation on gay marriage.

Kathryn wanted pants. And short hair. Then trucks and swords. Read more on The Washington Post
Spare me the line about how your anti-gay views are unassailable because they're your firmly held religious beliefs. It's utterly hollow. Hate wrapped in the name of God is still hate.
With so much hate continually aimed at the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, we like to take a moment every
\My fan base is very 'red state' typically,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people who are the most fervent supporters of mine
The next partner, who started this search of self-identity, asked \why\ during a work day near the end of the relationship
I think his apology, though welcome, is an evasion
Following Barack Obama's surprise public support for gay marriage, incoming French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande may be poised
It was a brave step, I thought, for my mom. She didn't know how it would turn out. It was a chance she was willing to take. She knew she didn't have it wrong. She had always known. She had been happy to let me come out in my own time, but something encouraged her to make the first move.
When I learned of President Obama's support of same sex-marriage this week, my emotions ran amok -- surprise, hope, excitement, joy -- joy because the marriage of my daughter and daughter-in-law was recognized as a good thing by the highest office in the land.
David Pickup, who is registered with the California Board of Psychology, told the Associated Press that a ban would deprive
I've never before known a time when the man in the Oval Office openly supported the union my moms share. Perhaps it's a foolish sentiment buoyed by an impending Mother's Day -- or, in my case, Mothers' Day -- but I can't shake the feeling that it just got a little better.
Last month, the Boy Scouts of America notified me that I would no longer be allowed to serve as leader of my son's Scouts troop, because I'm gay and pose a \distraction\ to the Scouts' core values. This Mother's Day, I have a message for the Boy Scouts
On this Mother's Day we will honor our little family of three. We will celebrate our love, our commitment, and our journey as parents of an amazing child who inspires us to laugh, love, and enjoy and accept life's lessons.
Last year, on Mother's day, I found out I was pregnant. I can hardly believe it's been a year since that gleeful Mother's Day. Only a year later, and life is a completely different shade of tumbling.  I have become the mother of a rather scrumptious little girl.
I spent much of the spring working on defeating anti-gay Amendment 1 in North Carolina. It's been my habit, after major wins or losses, to reflect on what went right and what went wrong, and offer some thoughts. Here are some of those along with some analysis.
Our schools must help children learn tolerance and respect for one another, so that no child leaves school with the fear that they will be attacked for their differences, and no child grows up believing it's OK to marginalize or discriminate against others.
Rather than simply tease or pick on Lauber, Romney initiated the violent use of force against Lauber, attempting to ensure that Lauber appeared in a fashion acceptable to Romney.
Flying in the face of the national trend in favor of same-sex marriage, Indiana Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Gregg announced his support of a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriages and civil unions.
I am reaching out to other moms who might or might not accept of the fact that their son or daughter is gay.  Most of you do not know what it is like to receive a phone call like I got at 4:30 a.m. telling me that something had happened to my child.
In those moments when my mom argued with other moms over the maternity of her children, I saw that no matter what I told her, no matter whom I became, she would always love me, and she would always fight for me. And she has done that.

Mama, just know how much I love you and miss you when you're not around. You're the coolest. Happy Mother's Day to you, and to all the moms out there who are loving enough to support and stand by their children no matter what.
I grapple with social forces that demonize me as ill-fit to be a mother because I'm transgender and have an unconventional family, just as they demonized my mom for being a single mother.
Of course, our moms are -- and have always been -- special. \I once heard the saying that a mother's relationship with her
This Mother's Day? I'm going to let the kids celebrate their two dads and the \mommyness\ each of us has within. And they can wear whatever the hell they want to wear and do any dance they feel like doing, because that's the kind of mom I had as a kid -- and the kind of \mom\ I'd like to be!
This year I don't think I am going to celebrate Mother's Day. Instead, I am going to celebrate a \Family Day\ with the one I have built and love.  And I am going to celebrate by thinking of all those times that those boys who made me a \mom\ have made me laugh and smile.
An event recently occurred that I've yet to shake. Someone insinuated that I hate women, and although I'd never remotely thought that to be the case, as we approach Mother's Day I ironically find myself pondering how I feel about the opposite sex.

It seems that the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) requires not merely moral straightness but sexual and gender straightness, as well, for no gay, bisexual, or transgender scouts (youth members) or scouters (adult leaders) have the right and privilege of membership in the organization.
When our LGBT youth watch television and movies, we want them to see characters they would be proud of, not tragic figures who are surrounded by negative circumstances. They deserve to see normal, everyday characters who happen to be gay.

Little Edie Beale, fictional Norma Desmond, and Royce and Marilyn have unofficially been inducted into my Kooky Old Ladies Hall of Fame. They have that special something that appeals to LGBTQ people in particular. If you listen to the sounds of their souls, you will hear our common story.
\If they smell gay on you, it's over!\ This was stingingly declared by my friend, a prominent casting director.  She referred to the flat rejection actors face at auditions when they \seem gay,\ whether the part is gay or straight, large or small, no matter how right they might otherwise be for it.
On Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor, Bill O'Reilly recently worked himself and Gretchen Carlson into an absolute tizzy over an episode of Glee that featured a transgender teen. O'Reilly expressed his concern that Glee is glamorizing \alternative lifestyles.\
I share all this not because I want to say, \Look at me, I had a big old gay wedding,\ but because I had never truly realized how much our family and friends really love and support us, and how much America's anti-gay marriage zealots live in an alternative reality.
It was not until she began to question some financial improprieties that she says the national policy, which local chapters
On Friday evening, people from the community met on the corner of University Avenue and Main Street in Cedar Falls to mourn
I was startled by an acquaintance's recent use of the word \tranny.\ This was not a close friend, not someone who knew my son's story. It was a misguided attempt at humor, not a hateful rant. And yet. I longed to find some way to tell her how painful this word is to so many people.
Most if not all the other names used for the procedure suggest that a person is making a choice to switch genders. This is not about choice; it's about using surgery as one of the therapeutic tools to enable people to be comfortable with their gendered self.
You don't want the first impression you create to be the reason you don't advance to the next level. You want to sell yourself without distraction, and without a hiring manager making a conscious (or unconscious) judgment about your professional skill set based on some ink.

The words \Jesus\ and \gay\ seem to be intertwining a lot lately. While the concept of the LGBT community and the life of Christ may be new to some, it's certainly something I'm very used to, having played a gay Jesus in the play Corpus Christi for the past six years.

I began intensely editing United in Anger about three years ago and finished it at the end of 2011. What I have tried to convey is the urgency of people who, battling a deadly epidemic that threatened their lives, culture, and community, chose to fight back and remake the world.
In more than 25 years of reporting on AIDS, I have been honored to know many heroes of the AIDS epidemic. Not all of them have been as visible or vocal as Kramer and ACT UP, but the contributions they made, the prices they paid, the risks they took were just as real.
The gender binary and its relationship to bullying may be an elusive and challenging concept for many, because it requires us to self-reflect, examine our own expectations, and perhaps even change some of them.  No one wants to feel he or she is part of the problem. But we are, all of us.

In a span of 24 hours, about a hundred tweets took the \#ToMyUnbornChild\ message and turned into anti-gay vitriol so heinous I couldn't stomach it. I became determined to take back these words of hate, so I began cutting and pasting words from the tweets to create poems.
What happened to Trayvon Martin is gay news. I am a gay man, and it affects my life. Moreover, as LGBT people, we have to be aware that Trayvon is not one isolated case but a continuation of a death narrative that both black and gay people suffer from and should work to overcome together.

To some in the LGBTQ community, Cleo Manago is a dangerous demagogue. But to tens of thousands African-American brothers and generous funders, he's seen as a brother driven with a dream. And he's perhaps dangerous because he's effecting change.
