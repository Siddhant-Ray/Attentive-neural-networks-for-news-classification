The thought of young mothers discovering poisons in their breast milk froze me in place while tears filled my eyes. The young mothers are not alone. The entire world is worthy of tears.
Last year I flew 77,000 miles on 30 flights over 9 work trips, releasing an additional 11 tons of CO2. This means that flying for work quadrupled my emissions last year.
Despite getting explicit mention in the original climate change treaty, agriculture has never been amongst the key issues at subsequent climate negotiations. Quite a surprise considering the headline facts and figures.
Sometime around 10,000 BC, a prehistoric human smeared ochre paint on a cave wall in a part of northern Spain that would eventually be known as Altamira. The artist painted an image from his environment - a bison - in vibrant burnt orange.
Leading up to the 2015 climate talks, the importance of national policies in addressing climate change is beyond vital. We must decide how we contribute to the climate agenda with our national priorities, circumstances and capabilities with referene to the global framework that drives collective action toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.

Hundreds upon hundreds of synthetic flower petal crowns travel with Gamand on her shelter trips to ensure she finds the right look for each dog.
Ton after ton of coal shoveled year after year into row upon row of smoking furnaces and hissing boilers, stretching to the crimson horizon, has spawned a sulfurous monster, a sooty golem who now awakens to stalk the earth.
The standard forecasts used throughout the transportation industry do not consider the kinds of walkable, mixed-use environments found often in city neighborhoods. As a result, the forecasts typically overestimate the amount of traffic likely to be associated with much urban development. That's a problem for proponents of urban development alternatives to suburban sprawl.
Cuban coral reefs -- accounting for nearly a third of the coral reefs in the Caribbean -- do not appear to exhibit the more widespread disease and mortality occurring in other sites of the region.
Unfortunately, marine debris dumped by faraway lands, as well as some dumped by islands with dwindling amounts of usable land, threatens our livelihoods, our culture and our economies.
By creating this oceanic \sanctuary\ in partnership with the Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF), NASF has been able to direct its efforts toward improving conditions and increasing the survival rates of salmon present in coastal waters and rivers.


It is time for the World Bank and the DRC government to embrace more feasible solutions and stop holding the Congolese population hostage to their multi-billion dollar dreams.


As EIA's report demonstrates, however, simply including environmental obligations in trade pacts provides no guarantee that environmental protections will improve in reality.
Leading the opposition to the clean water rule are Republican congressional lawmakers and conservative think tanks such as the Federalist Society. In deploring Washington's increased protection of freshwater resources, critics ignore the U.S. Government Accountability Office's recent survey of state water managers.
Imagine going to spend a day at the beach with friends or family, looking to recharge your batteries at some of California's most treasured destinations. But before you hit the sand, you encounter razor wire. Or a locked gate. Or an oddly placed boulder.
We should cheer the journey that these companies are taking on but we should not lose sight of the destination, which is to see sustainably produced palm oil being used in products we buy.
This is, so far, the most monumental victory in the fight to save Africa's elephants, and a major push back against greed, status symbols and corruption.
Yes, vegan products, like vegan people, are healthy, natural and can compete with what's out there in the conventional but unsustainable marketplace, but let's call them -- and us -- what we are. Vegan.
Foreign vessels have been plundering the waters of West Africa for decades to stock the fish markets of Europe and Asia. Industrial fishing is depriving West African people of a vital source of protein and pushing thousands of locals into poverty and despair.
So how do we stop overfishing, and encourage fish populations to rebound? It's an achievable goal, when tackled with a country-by-country approach.
Last year, the EPA signaled that it will announce a stricter ground-level ozone standard this fall. South Louisiana and other warm, sunny places tend to be high in \bad\ ozone. After a struggle, Baton Rouge and neighboring parishes with refineries and petrochemical plants have managed to comply with EPA's current ozone standard.

Enbridge Corporation is offering a treaty to the people of Minnesota. Like Inktomi, Enbridge offers promises of riches and an easy life. Is this yet another offering from the Trickster?

If we continue with our reckless burning of fossil fuels, there will be widespread war and conflict this century, warns Lord Nicholas Stern, the distinguished chairman of the Grantham Institute on climate change, whilst speaking before a packed auditorium at the London School of Economics on Wednesday.
Imagine my delight when, walking my neighborhood in Santa Cruz, CA, I realized a major success story is blooming right under my nose

REDD could, in theory, help them address their needs and keep illegal logging at bay, but to earn REDD offsets, they'll have to prove two things.


When this baby's rescuer heard the sound of high-pitched screaming, she immediately ran outside to see what was going on.
Indeed, we could view our era's progress as proof of our improving, better nature. But if we're paying attention with both eyes open, we can also see how the industries that profit from animal exploitation continue to fight advances in animal welfare and law every step of the way.
With summer fast approaching, the impacts of climate change are hitting home with even greater force. NRDC recently reported that climate change is linked to more pollen and smog, threatening more asthma and allergy attacks across the country.


The voluntary carbon markets have served as the testing ground for compliance programs all over the world, even moving forward when efforts to implement mandatory cap-and-trade programs stalled. This has led to the voluntary markets having an influence that extends well beyond the nearly 1 billion offsets transacted over the last decade.
In every action I strive to educate and facilitate ways that will tear down the industrial agricultural chemical complex and replace it with a sustainable organic future. I will never leave that Iowa dream.
Ultimately, if we want to fill our glasses with clean water, and if we want our kids to swim, fish, or play safely in our waters, we have to be willing to protect our all nation's waters, large and small, from the Great Lakes to the headwater streams.
I am optimistic that we can still get on course for a 2\u00b0C future. It won't be easy, but the discussions last week in Paris provide many reasons to believe this transformation is underway -- and gaining steam.
The circus of lies, denial and propaganda videos that has become the Chevron annual shareholder meeting took place at Chevron's San Ramon, California headquarters once again yesterday.
We are giving companies our money while they are making record profits -- and paying nothing for the harm they do us with their pollution.
Make no mistake, loss of familiar species such as elephants and sharks would be a global tragedy, not to mention a blow to the planet's rich biodiversity that nurtures healthy, productive ecosystems. But these well-publicized large species are at the top of the food chain.
While safeguards for our drinking water have now been signed and sealed, they won't get delivered if polluters and their allies in Congress stand in the way.
Cities around the world are rushing to commit to running on 100-percent renewable energy as soon as possible. It may be a great idea, but can a major metropolis actually achieve the goal? We'll find out by watching Vancouver in British Columbia, where the city council voted in March to go 100-percent renewable by about 2030.

I found his statement both reassuring and unsettling. It was comforting to see that Mr. Bush acknowledges the climate is changing. Reading between the lines on whether humans are to blame, however, implies that there's little or nothing we can or should do to mitigate the damage.

Unfolding with the plaintive air of an elegy, Blood on the Mountain captures mining companies' blatant disregard for the health and lives of coal miners -- and the mountains they call home -- as a timely reminder of the legacy of an essentially outlaw industry and its 150-year reign in West Virginia.

Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for us, anyone knows that. Award-winning culinary photographer Paulette Phlipot reminds us they're also the source of \simplicity, joy and fun. How can you not be happy looking at a cherry?\


I joined the WCS Malaysia team on a trek recently through the rainforest of Endau-Rompin, a state park in the southern part of Johor on Peninsular Malaysia. To get to this remote rainforest, you drive many hours past acre after acre of oil palm, through a forest reserve, and then you are there.


Last week, the American Petroleum Institute -- the primary lobbying group for the oil and gas industry -- hit a new low in their use of deceptive advertising.

I have a duty not to interfere with your freedom of speech for example. Positive rights are duties I have to do things for you -- like a duty to provide you with food. Philosophy is pretty good at generating an account of negative rights.
Oil companies and elected officials pledge to protect our coastline with more safety measures, yet promote exposing more of our prized beaches to the risks of oil and gas extraction.


The long-neglected Watts neighborhood in South Los Angeles is moving forward with an exciting new revitalization partnership that envisions a transformed \Main Street,\ transit-oriented development, and state-of-the-art \green streets,\ among other features.

Even a magic golden plunger is no match for \flushable\ wet wipes. Plungers long ago gave way to workers wielding pitchforks in the battle against sewers filled with giant, clinging balls of waste known as used wet wipes. And we are paying the price.


Eventually we will run out of fossil fuel and we'll be operating on solar, wind, wave, and maybe fusion power. Who knows? But there will be an end to oil and gas... and coal. But it isn't the same for our nation's national parks, unless we fail to plan wisely.
These Dutch men and women (under the auspices of an activist environmental organization that calls itself Urgenda -- as in \urgent agenda\) have sued their government over its ongoing role in the emission of carbon gases and the resulting climate change.

Species are already being erased and humans are creating their own geological epoch rather than natural forces. Frighteningly, we don't even entirely understand what all of this will mean or ultimately lead to.
In her new book, Victoria Moran espouses a diet high in karma, the good kind. That means foods that are plant-based and animal-friendly... and more than vegan ice cream and cupcakes.
It's a time to reflect on how each of us -- individually and collectively -- can do our part to help reverse human impact on the environment that has resulted in what has been called the earth's sixth great extinction event.
On the other, the $6 billion Pembina Pipeline Corporation, the largest pipeline company in the Canadian tar sands, and a plan to build the largest private investment project in Portland, OR, history -- a $500 million propane export terminal.

For the person that has the money and wants the Panamera 4S should buy this plugin hybrid technology to boot. It's a great green electrified and luxurious car. It does stand out on the road and you can also feel good about it's MPG and EV modes.

Just over a decade ago, the state of California faced serious concerns about whether its utilities could generate and/or buy enough power to assure that the world's seventh-largest economy could keep the lights on.
Climate change is happening now and it's happening globally--it affects everyone everywhere. However, climate change will not affect everyone equally.
Not that it will do any good, but I implore Professor Dyson to take a good hard look at the scientific evidence and think again -- especially because his deserved scientific eminence may lead the public to overindulge at his smorgasbord of misconceptions.
Growing up, I seemed almost earmarked for the financial world, as I was both studious and materialistic. I was a small mass of seriousness--a little librarian--completing my assignments early and happily. But my core longed for more, mentally, materially.
You might not be familiar with the term, but the practice is paying huge dividends in a state that is desperate to protect its abundant natural resources.

The task before sustainability educators is to take the inspiring energy and enthusiasm of our students and channel it into an effort to develop the conceptual and analytic tools needed to conduct high quality management and policy analyses.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) asked a good question last month. He wanted to know, \What is the environmental platform of the Republican Party?\ Graham said he doesn't know and suggested that it's time for his party to do some \soul searching.\ He is right to suggest some soul searching, but I'm surprised he doesn't know the party's platform.




A recent peer-reviewed study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has confirmed what many fracking critics have argued for years
Pythagoras' life spans most of the sixth century and early fifth century before our common era. He is a one of the greatest Greek thinkers of all time.
Exelon's\u00a0ultimate goal:\u00a0Force Pepco's customers, including the people of Washington,\u00a0D.C., to subsidize Exelon's expensive nuclear power plants in other states. D.C. residents have until May 26 to submit comments to the Public Service Commission.

As we continue to work toward a fuller understanding of the presence of water, what we may not know so well is called \virtual water\ -- the water that is used to produce almost everything we incorporate into our daily routines but is not listed on the label or calculated into the price.


Here are three types of products you should put a little thought into before purchasing, as the wrong varieties can have lasting, harmful effects on our waterways, our environment, and ourselves.
The dying seas are an economic issue as well as a survival issue, and the corporate leaders of Legal Sea Foods and Taylor Shellfish of Washington will be speaking at the summit about preserving our fish stocks.
A gathering of \urban green innovators,\ as they were called, yielded a crop of optimism about the myriad environmental challenges facing New Yorkers in the coming years. \Count the short-term victories,\ and \Keep your eyes on the prize,\ appeared to be some of the main messages from the event.
The more I read about California's drought, the more it feels like an episode of TNT's Dallas reboot. Are the hazards of fracking akin to those of groundwater drilling? One contaminates it and the other depletes it. And in case depletion doesn't scare you enough, now groundwater drilling is collapsing the Central Valley.
To pursue legislative action to restrict ivory sales in the United States, the 96 Elephants campaign has followed Hornaday's tested movement strategy

Anthony \Tony\ Podesta began lobbying in late 2013 on behalf of a company co-owned by ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum aiming to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the global market.
When Governor Andrew Cuomo decided to ban fracking in New York State in December 2014, New Yorkers thought their worries were over. They were wrong.

Some people live wonder-free lives. For those who work with sea turtles, awe can be a daily experience. When we share our work, we make the world better. More sea turtle lovers equal more ocean advocates -- a virtuous, positive feedback loop.

While national governments have struggled to work together to solve the global-climate crisis, mayors are cooperating through organizations like the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40) to deliver concrete results.
Through rising seas, withering drought, catastrophic storms and other hallmarks of climate change, our world is telling us every way it knows how that it's time to cut the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving the climate crisis. Long before history judges our response, voters will decide which candidate best understands the threat we face.
Climate change is no longer a myth or conspiracy, but a cruel reality which we must now face. My generation and future generations will have to live longer with the consequences of current patterns and be subject to their impacts.


Block Island calls itself the \Last Great Place,\ but this small island 12 miles off the coast of Rhode Island is first in the hearts of environmentalists and clean energy advocates across the nation today. Big things are happening just off the shore of that little island.
Just like when bombs, chaos and death were so common in Sri Lanka during the civil war, environmental disasters have become so common here. Sadly, after a period of time, these various harbingers of death lose their novelty and we do not have the energy to herald them.
Dharnai, a solar-powered village in India, shows how we can make the renewables boom deliver for all -- including the rural poor. Dharnai is located in Bihar, one of the poorest provinces in India. It did not have access to electricity for 30 years before a solar mini-grid was installed with the support of Greenpeace India in July last year.
We need to change the narrative around climate change. Instead of a call-to-arms, we need a doctrine of \mutually assured survival\ -- a doctrine in which all commit to the goal of 100% renewable energy.
For the past decade, an epidemic called White-Nose Syndrome has had severe impacts on bat populations throughout North America. The fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, feeds on soft tissues of bats such as their wings and noses.
Too often, African American voices are excluded from discussions about the critical issues facing our country. Recently the NAACP developed a report that shows how fossil fuels play a significantly harmful role in the health of African Americans and other communities of color.
It's time foundations stepped up their game when it comes to climate. That's the message from two foundations that have invested big in climate
Good governance means embracing an environmental review process that includes the people and governments who are most affected by proposed projects, rather than one that robs stakeholders of their voices.
When complete, First Solar's California Flats project will generate enough electricity to power Apple's Cupertino headquarters complex, as well as its California stores and data centers. Many have hailed this as a first step toward more widespread commercial adoption of solar power.
You've probably heard it all by now. Almondgate, the Devil Eats Marzipan, the 1.1 gallons of water it takes to grow an almond -- which is a lot, but a little misleading when it isn't put into perspective.
Since 1970, Earth has had one special day a year when we take a moment and really think about our planet -- through demonstrations, fundraisers, volunteering, river cleanups, and other means of generally bringing our environment front and center.
The first Earth Day was an inspiration. On that day in 1970, 20 million people turned out to demand the protection and restoration of the earth, air, water, forests, natural lands, and species that support, sustain, and enrich every aspect of our lives.
Today, on Earth Day, let's continue to protect ourselves, and ask our politicians to vote for policies that protect us.  Included in that is a campaign to defeat the newest sponsor of terrorism -- climate change.
An ambitious document, the \Ecomodernist Manifesto\ makes bold claims about history, philosophy, technology, and economics. Its authors, an eclectic group, are working with foundational myths.

Meatless Monday was a great start, but it's time to flip the paradigm. Eat meat and other animal products only one day a week or better yet not at all.
Today it seems clear that it will not be political leaders or new policies that will save us from environmental destruction though they can help us along, nor will it be a national revolt as envisioned by the religious zealots of our time.
Project Finance for Permanence is one of the greatest innovations of our time to secure permanent funding for our precious and vulnerable landscapes. It holds governments accountable to their long-term conservation commitments.
Under President Obama's Clean Power Plan, we can cut power-plant carbon pollution 26 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2030, when compared with 2005 levels. We can do even better than that, but what matters most is that we get started now.
McDonald's just pledged to only buy food and raw materials from around the world that don't contribute to deforestation, a significant contributor to global warming. Given McDonald's reach, that's a potential game-changer.

\Losing a species is like losing a library full of books,\ said Dr. Dyer to the roomful of young researchers. Each species and its diverse interactions is a Shakespearian play, he continued, and threats ranging from habitat destruction to climate change are destroying a library that, in many cases, has never been read.
Unlike global warming, green began to cool off. It became over-used and over-done. It became politicized, with more extreme views polarizing and blurring the issues. People got tired of false and confusing claims by companies.
The G7 Foreign Ministers can take a leading role in avoiding the increased weakening and even total collapse of states and societies threatened by fragility challenges. As evidence demonstrates, one does not need to reinvent the wheel for this.
The SDGs will require huge global monitoring and reporting efforts. This is a pivotal moment for international development; the current negotiations could change the lives of billions of people.
Five years on, though, what lessons have been learned? Don't trust oil companies to act responsibly? That seems to be the main takeaway for the Obama administration.
DeSmogBlog has obtained dozens of emails that lend an inside view of how the U.S. State Department secretly handed Enbridge a permit to expand the capacity of its U.S.-Canada border-crossing Alberta Clipper pipeline.
How are members of Congress celebrating Earth Day this year?  Planting trees? Recycling? Passing legislation that will further protect our air, land, water and wildlife for generations? Guess again.

We must not sacrifice our bedrock environmental, public-health, and climate safeguards as the price of a free-trade agreement. Unfortunately, what we have seen from the two pending trade agreements raises serious concerns that these standards could be weakened through the various provisions of these trade agreements.
Climate change is such a massive issue that thinking about strategies for combating its effects -- or even trying to prevent them -- can be frustrating as well as daunting. Luckily, there is an ever increasing number of people that are hard at work finding solutions for problems that are small-scale and often geographically localized. Think of transport, for example. Now narrow the focus down to a single activity, parcel transport for online purchases.
Five years after the BP blowout that killed 11 workers and dumped millions of barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, the Obama administration has proposed exposing Atlantic and Arctic waters to the risk of a similar disaster. It's time to turn this ship around -- before it's too late.

Climate change is advancing. Its effects can be felt already today and will increase significantly in the coming decades even if the global community sets ambitious targets for reducing emissions at the end-of-year climate change negotiations in Paris.
In order for scientists to continue to develop these non-fossil based alternatives and for business to scale these solutions, we need the right economic incentives. Now, with relatively low oil prices, is an excellent time to introduce a carbon price system.
Earlier last week, the Obama administration unveiled a blueprint for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by up to 28 percent over the next decade and submitted the formal statement to the to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Obama administration has now launched new offshore oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Rather than heed the warnings of Deepwater Horizon, the administration seems determined to double-down on dangerous offshore drilling.


The much ballyhooed legal challenge to the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan, brought by coal companies and conservative state attorneys-general, ran out of steam Thursday in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
Presenting climate change and its causes as the consensus that it is, and not the debate that it has become, would both inform public beliefs on climate change, and force politicians to act.

With humanity rapidly depleting earth's natural resources, the challenge to reverse the trend is daunting. Enter biomimicry, a promising strategy for turning the tide.
It is not possible to support the use of fossil fuels and the climate simultaneously. True climate leaders have no option but to tackle head-on the damaging economic entrenchment of the coal, oil and gas industry.
The mass killings of elephants during the war disrupted elephant societies, leaving the orphans and traumatized survivors aggressively weary of the presence of humans. The park, with the assistance of Dr. Joyce Poole and her brother, cameraman Bob Poole, are building a mutually beneficial relationship with the elephants of the park.
Palmer never grew out of his curiosity about how things work -- or how they could be improved. So one night off the Florida coast in 2001, as the commercial fisherman patiently waited for swordfish to bite, he started thinking.
Decades ago, Gov. Wally Hickel was ridiculed for his idea of an ocean pipeline carrying fresh Alaska water to parched California. Now entrepreneurs are hoping that they can make good on his general concept by selling clear water from Southeast Alaska's rainforest to users in the dry south.

Seven thousand people pledged to go meatless for US Veg Week in 2014, and armed with the support of Raskin, Carter, Esther and others, Meier's hoping to make that number closer to 10,000 this year.

Just a few hours into the protest, students, alumni, faculty and activists have made their point
Let's be real

In the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, indigenous people are harvesting sacha inchi -- as they have been for 3,000 years. And on screens around the world, Dr. Oz, among others, touts the nut-like seed for its high nutritional value and delicious flavor. It's fast becoming a grocery store favorite
Here's the important point
Franzen's essay deserved a more considered and respectful response. The issues he raised are complicated and important. They deserve our careful reflection, not hit pieces from angry content editors on the web sites of prominent environmental organizations.
In his note, Izurieta urged his supporters to carry on without him


Following close to 5000 emails and a letter from over 40 environmental and human rights NGOs, a spirited group of activists disrupted the San Francisco Commonwealth Club's annual gala last week.

Members of Congress used to respect the president's constitutional role to speak for our country with one voice in foreign affairs. But, like the recent letter from 47 Republican Senators to the Iranian mullahs, McConnell's \just say no\ message to foreign leaders shows that those days are gone.

Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has responded defensively to the oil-by-rail lawsuit filed by former BNSF locomotive engineer Bryan Thompson, a case recently reported on by DeSmogBlog.
Lately, there's been a spate of good news about organic agriculture. The movement is growing and gaining speed quickly. The power of the people is working!
With this new support of $30 million over three years, we plan to double down on our past success and secure replacement of half the nation's coal plants with clean energy by 2017.


An increasing number of legal experts around the world have come to believe that the lack of government action to prevent dangerous climate change represents a gross violation of the rights of those who will suffer the consequences. These arguments are at the core of the Dutch lawsuit and will undoubtedly be put to the test in other countries before too long.

We need a new idea and system of law that will enable an alternative to collapse or chaos. As an advocate for the ocean and the global water cycle as that idea, I have been unable to establish the principle and precedent on which such a system of law might be based -- until now.
Scientists and climate policy wonks usually say global warming is caused by \human activities.\ This shorthand obscures an important point

Long considered one of the greenest places in America, The Emerald City recently ramped up its commitment to a clean environment by introducing a new bike share program.




A March 24 hearing prior to the passage of a controversial bill out of committee that preempts cities in Texas from regulating hydraulic fracturing (\fracking\) for oil and gas obtained from shale basins, featured numerous witnesses who failed to disclose their industry ties, including some with ties to the Koch brothers.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of the Interior swung the door wide open to drilling in the remote waters of the iconic Arctic Ocean when it announced that it was reaffirming controversial Bush-era leases for the Chukchi Sea - a lease sale referred to as Lease Sale 193.

While many members of Congress remain wary of the costs of reducing climate change pollution, they need look no further than the largest state economy in our nation for a perfect example of how to take action.

On April 3, 1980, Walter Cronkite, the so-called \most trusted man in America,\ spent a few minutes of the CBS Evening News exploring the implications of coal burning and its carbon dioxide emissions for global warming.
Last year we got a preview, when the Rockefeller family stunned the media and markets by announcing it will sell all its investments in coal and tar sands.

As a consumer overwhelmed by the profusion of brands, it's increasingly more confusing and difficult to know what's right for your little Balthazar or Zorro. In the past we relied on our gut.

As a parent of two, I have watched many cartoons in my life. From Spongebob Squarepants to Blue Clues to Dora the Explorer. Yet not many cartoons (excluding the recycling symbol) seem to effectively convey the needs of the environment.
Today is the last day of women's history month. This year, two fantastic women senators will mark the ends of their historic Senate careers. Senators Barbara Boxer and Barbara Mikulski have served a collective 70 years in Congress. In those decades, they've established themselves as strong environmental champions.
When the U.S. is willing to step forward domestically, it can have a catalyzing impact in other countries. This is evident in the new commitment from China to peak its emissions -- a commitment no one thought was possible just a few short years back. This commitment occurred only after the U.S. showed that it was taking strong domestic action.
Why and how did my water source run dry? What could I do about it? Would I too need to import water? Melt snow? Go without? Move away? Like S\u00e3o Paulo, I considered myself \water-rich\ with a seemingly inexhaustible supply. Suddenly, it was not so. What to do?

Despite experts agreeing that killing the cormorants is wrong and won't work, it turns out that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is planning to kill nearly 11,000 cormorants and destroy more than 26,000 of their nests to try to reduce cormorant numbers by more than half.
Over time, we can expect institutions that divest from fossil fuels to face additional pressure, not less pressure, to reduce their electricity consumption from fossil fuels, and to direct their research efforts toward non-fossil energy sources.
To save lives, and to begin to satisfy the city's dire water infrastructure needs, Detroit needs to expand the current assistance programs and enact the Water Affordability Plan (WAP) approved by the City Council in 2006.



The Harvard position, examined through the lens of John Donne's insight, is indefensible.  It is Janus-faced and cynically hypocritical. The University accepts the science of climate change and the catastrophes that scientists (including Harvard scholars) foresee if radical changes in energy usage are not made.

Pebble and its Beltway-based CEO announced this week the hiring of two Washington, D.C. consulting firms to \conduct an independent review\ of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (\EPA\) work on the proposed mine.
Senate Republican leaders had been eyeing a raft of votes into the wee hours Friday as a chance to put a spike in the heart of President Obama's plan to confront the dangers of climate change.
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that for the World Bank and other financiers, poor people who stand in the way of their projects literally don't count. Time and again, the World Bank has demonstrated that it is not able to resettle people fairly. It should stop displacing people involuntarily in its projects.
In order to have a well-balanced dog, we have to teach her the house rules, and set boundaries and limitations from the get-go. The message you send your dog the moment she enters your home for the first time is critical, because it immediately establishes the ground rules in your dog's mind.
Those negotiations are important, but the games really begin next week. March 31st is the first checkpoint when several countries, including the United States, will announce new targets to reduce climate pollution and other commitments to support climate action.
With more water regulations on the horizon, Californians  have to learn to live with less water and start figuring out ways to conserve  now.
In spite of these efforts, there is one resource that Brazil is ignoring

Late last week, hundreds of organizations and people sent a letter to President Obama warning that his administration is running of time to act on an issue long-identified by the president as essential to our national security and public safety
Forests benefit the world, and each of us, every day in countless ways that are all too easy to overlook. On this year's International Day of Forests, let's make a promise to do more to ensure healthy, productive forests for future generations.
While others ignore these threats, I am taking a stand. I hope not to solve all the wrongdoings of humans, but to help inform and educate teens of the madness that is looming. Our next generation of adults must pay attention to what is happening to our natural surroundings.

From massive desalination plants that turn saltwater into tap water, to carbon nanotubes that suck moisture out of the air, to a machine that burns human waste at 1,000 degrees Celsius to produce water and electricity, there's no shortage of high-tech solutions to address the world's water problems.

Perhaps no group of science deniers has been more ridiculed than those who deny the science of evolution. What you may not know is that Monsanto and our United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) are among them.

Zimbabwe's plan to send the young elephants overseas has drawn criticism from many wildlife conservationists. They see the government's plan as a cynical and cruel move against an animal that is being slaughtered at alarming rates for its ivory, especially to satisfy demand in China.
Climate change stands to trigger a regime change in Alaska, with far-reaching consequences as frozen ground thaws beneath us, a prominent University of Alaska Fairbanks scientist told the Tanana Chiefs Conference on Tuesday. \When you thaw the permafrost, everything falls apart,\ said hydrologist Larry Hinzman.
Utilities make their money by building big, new infrastructure projects and then sending ratepayers the bill. This is exactly why utilities want to eliminate policies that encourage homeowners and businesses to go solar.
What is oddest about opposition to action to address climate change is the implications for another priority of the Republican party

For the first time in 40 years, global carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector did not increase. During 2014, the global economy grew by 3 percent but emissions remained at 2013 levels.
Every state generates electricity from a unique mix of resources, which is why the EPA designed so much flexibility into the Clean Power Plan. Each state has the opportunity to craft its own approach to cut carbon pollution. And the best methods by far when it comes to reducing pollution, protecting health, and creating jobs come from renewable energy and energy efficiency.
Refusing to acknowledge that our planet is heating up and pretending not to understand the science doesn't stop it from happening. Every day our lawmakers waste by censoring climate change and throwing snowballs in the Senate will have consequences for our children and future generations to come. It's time to face the facts.
Five months ago, the stars were looking aligned for this year's climate summit in Paris. The US and China, the world's largest carbon polluters, had just signed a historic action plan to curb their emissions.

This divorce between emissions and economy is one of the most promising developments imaginable. For too long conventional wisdom decreed that the only way to reduce emissions would be to reduce economic development, but 2014 data shows that may no longer to be true.
Scientists believe that this round of mass extinction is accelerating, and one way or another, it all traces back to us, whether thanks to the way we are changing the planet's atmosphere or to what Kolbert terms a human-induced, often disastrous \intercontinental reshuffling of species.\
We pet owners are the ones who hear the diagnosis. The patient cannot speak, has no language to tell us about pain or recurring symptoms (apart from That Look). We are thus doubly vulnerable -- we have to believe what we're told because there is no recourse.
Ridley's assertion that because fossil fuels provided the energy for development in the past means they should keep investing in fossil fuel infrastructure is like saying that developing countries should build punch-card computers for their technological needs.

Altaeros Energies' Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT) is designed to go where no wind turbine has gone before
There is still time to affirm that we do have better ways to create good jobs and shared, sustainable prosperity.... that our community is in many ways defined by that better way.
Please take a moment to think about what you can do to protect the arteries of our planet. We can all avoid products that waste and pollute valuable water. We can educate our children about a way of life that respects the ecosystems of our planet.
A reinvigorated \People's Foot\ movement to end mountaintop removal is ramping up its efforts next week, as the last vestiges of outside support begin to abandon the nation's most egregious strip mining operations in central Appalachia.
For decades, the residents of River Rouge and surrounding communities have been living with severe air pollution from nearby coal plants, and together, they came out in force to pack a public hearing and call on the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to put a plan in place that will finally clean up this pollution and correct a longstanding environmental injustice.
One of the world's top emitters, the EU intends to reduce its emissions 40 percent (relative to 1990 levels) by 2030. This commitment is in addition to 2050 emissions reduction targets that a recent report published by the European Environment Agency claims may prove difficult to reach.
There's a very special sport you can participate in that will help you enjoy a rough winter
Biking in Amsterdam for a weekend can open your eyes and mind to re-think of renewable sources of energy, an economic sustained growth, and a green and less polluted environment.
You need more than intelligence to create a connection with Mother Nature. Many of us have lost that connection and it is reflected in our animals. Dogs are our mirror and when they're not following us it's because we're not balanced.
Last week I assembled a group of nature \do-gooders\ at the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center in Annapolis MD. And I asked them what difference their well-intended actions really make.
Walmart's new green labels are more of the same -- a way to keep the public conversation about the company's impact confined within its own narrow terms, all the while obscuring the deep problems at the heart of Walmart's business model.

On March 11 let's take time to honor those who are suffering from the effects of the Fukushima disaster. Let us honor them by coming together as one people to address water issues globally.
The fact that men, almost without exception, led the environmental movement came somewhat as a surprise to me. I had formed the false assumption that conservation work was one area that naturally offered more equitable women leadership. \nIt still doesn't.

Women are the primary victims of climate change, for it is poor communities who suffer the worst of its impacts, and women make up 70 percent of those in poverty throughout the world. As a result, they are, and will continue to be, the most heavily affected. But as the primary victims of climate change, women are also often the main source of solutions.



Cod were once so abundant in the Gulf of Maine that they propped up many of New England's coastal economies. Those financial boons, though, came with a heavy price.
Google is a forward-looking company. But are they looking forward to, and planning for, the now-unavoidable impacts of climate change as they design new multi-billion dollar infrastructure investments? Are the rest of us?
Fixing our rivers requires that we reintroduce complexity and function through restoration -- effectively reshaping the relationship between the economy and the environment.
Many of these are expected to come from Southeast Asian countries where the rush to achieve developed nation status has dealt a heavy hand to nature.
Everyday Iowa voters are less likely to caucus for former Texas governor and potential presidential candidate Rick Perry \because of his involvement\ with a controversial oil pipeline proposal, according to an influential state lawmaker who has made eminent domain one of his signature issues in the Iowa House of Representatives.

If you made a training mistake and your dog is engaging in unwanted or dangerous behavior, by all means interrupt it!

While the Sahara Forest Project may not achieve results like that for years--if ever--the test site is proving the concept today, and it's worth watching the project to see whether the technologies--and the economics--work out in the long run.


The author of this dramatic report is William deBuys, a prolific and important American writer. His latest of eight books, The Last Unicorn is an epitaph to the dying natural world in Laos. He tells his story by throwing light on a rare mammal known as the saola.

There are so many ways that we can support our kids on their paths to become healthy eaters and sustainable food advocates, but I've found the more fun we're having, the better it is for all of us.
Not only should we seek to achieve energy equity for all consumers, we also need to support diversity and inclusion efforts, and ensure that this is a priority for today's emerging, clean energy sector.

The panelists were told that, unlike all of the other sessions at the conference, the captivity panel wasn't going to be recorded.
The move to include natural carbon-sinks of forests and wet-lands into land-use reductions has been the main target for criticism.
Professor Roger J. Pielke, Jr. recently compared many widely-published energy and climate experts with Dr. Wei-Hock Soon, the subject of recent media attention for failing to follow conflict of interest (COI) rules at some scientific journals. There is no comparison whatsoever, and we ask Dr. Pielke to retract his accusations and apologize.

In celebration of World Wildlife Day, let us remember that wild animals have made us who we are. They are essential to our foundation, to our very existence. Wild animals keep our world alive. Without them, there is no us.
How deep is the hole the oil industry is currently stuck inside? To figure that out, you only need to look as far back as last week, which saw another two trainloads full of oil derail and storage numbers that put U.S. crude stocks at record highs

It would be shocking in a good way if Republicans took meaningful action in the next 10 months to reign in the nation's carbon emissions. And they could do the turnaround without compromising their core values. Quite the opposite
Even though this was a big one, it pales in comparison to the fire in Northwest Oregon in 1933, where fishing and timber are inseparable. Both resources must be nurtured, harvested, managed and passed on.

This coming Earth Day, let's celebrate with an Earth Gratitude Wave. It will be a time for you to consciously express your gratitude for the earth.

Our trip began gloriously. The whales in Mexico behaved as though they'd been waiting for us to arrive before starting their journey. They blew bubbles, bumped our boat, and poked up their noses within kissing distance.
No, climate change is not experiencing a hiatus. No, there is not currently a \pause\ in global warming. Despite widespread such claims in contrarian circles, human-caused warming of the globe proceeds unabated.


Learn about your dog's limits physically, take the heat into consideration, and have a time limit for your hike. If their tongue is hanging out of their mouth more than half way, it's a sign to stop and take a rest.

...meanwhile... from Sandro Bocci on Vimeo. Do we really know what lurks in the deep? A new short film showcases some of
Scott Blankenship, founder and CEO of www.amplifydpledges.com, a social activism startup based in Berkeley, California, is concerned about the health risks and antibiotic-laden milk.

The movement to divest from fossil fuels has become the fastest divestment campaign in history. To date, over 180 institutions and cities have committed to divest, and about $50 billion has already been divested.
One of the perks of my job is answering emails from high school and junior high students doing their first research projects on climate change science, policy, and politics.

We need an informed dialogue about how local solar power (large-scale and rooftop) can impact low-income communities and communities of color in the U.S. We need to talk about \all the good things, and the bad things, that may be.\


The fish and seafood business is tough. The practices and the general attitudes of many in our commercial seafood sector make it tougher than it needs to be.

This story\u00a0originally appeared on Climate Central. \u00a0 The depressing task of monitoring ocean acidification just got a little
So if you've been inspired like I was to stay away from non-stick coated cookware (and bakeware), here are some great PTFE-free alternatives to help you choose the best cookware for your home:
Let's hope that the killing of more wolves is not forthcoming. It is disheartening that there already are plans to kill more wolves supposedly to try to save caribou, and many are deeply concerned and working to stop this unnecessary slaughter.
From the '80s poaching crisis to the current poaching crisis, some of the players have changed, new markets have emerged, but there are many lessons from the past that we can learn from.  And we must. Because if we do not take the lessons of the past, we are doomed to repeat.
I learned that the Baltimore Oriole may no longer be in Maryland by the end of the century and that coastal species, like the sandpiper, were imperiled by rising sea levels.
It's having a farm to call your own, a farmer to learn from and a place to go if you want to get into the dirt. It transforms the way you think about a rain on a summer's day - it's good for the crops.
Unsurprisingly, there are a number of uncertainties and undesirable side-effects with this plan and some oppose even studying geoengineering. To date, there has been no major publicly funded research program in geoengineering.
The U.S. electricity sector will be unrecognizable in 20 years. How-- and how-- fast it changes will be a big factor in how large a price the world pay for having disrupted climate equilibrium - but it is not the climate threat that will drive the changes.
Valentine's Day may have passed, but my kids' haul of chocolate is still lingering. As I attempt to avoid eating just one more piece, I can't help but think about all the love for climate action we felt over the weekend.
The World Economic Forum is meeting this month in Davos, Switzerland. In advance of the meeting, a survey was conducted among some 900 leaders in business, politics, and civic life that concluded that the most important global risk faced today is the world water crisis.
Not enough is known to predict why the high pressure system occasionally allows an atmospheric river to sneak in and water California, though reports Andres Thompson at Climate Central. The latest river is far from significantly easing California drought.
If both sides in this culture clash focus less on people who drive them nuts, and more on goals we share, we could probably make progress more quickly.
Today, over 35 Harvard students are sitting in at Massachusetts Hall, outside President Drew Faust's office, to demand full divestment from the fossil fuel industry. We sit in because Harvard has a responsibility to do everything in its power to address the climate crisis.

It's always appalling to see animals abused and betrayed for profit, especially when the activity is legal and defended as a \sport.\ That's the reality of greyhound racing, but the reasons this detestable industry still exists defy not just our humane values, but common sense as well.
With both global Earth surface and global sea surface temperatures reaching record levels in 2014, pressure to reach a final climate accord is intense.
Years ago, while driving in Florida, I was pulled over by a state trooper on my way from Sarasota to Tampa to teach a class. Unbeknownst to me, my car had a broken taillight. The trooper asked for my license, which, it turns out, I accidentally left on my dresser.
Australia's largest ever coal project, Adani's proposed Carmichael coal mine in Queensland's Galilee Basin, has been found to have a murky and troubling maze of corporate arrangements spread across known tax havens.


When citizens see that their representatives work for special interests instead of the public good, their confidence in government erodes. They stop telling their representatives what to do, which only makes it easier for their representatives to work for special interests.
William R. Catton, Jr. -- one of the most significant and influential ecological thinkers of the past century -- died last month, just shy of his 89th birthday. Catton was an inspiration to a host of climate change, peak oil, and sustainability-oriented leaders.
Fifty years after President Johnson signaled a new concern to Congress in carbon pollution, we know he was right. Fifty years from now, how will the next generation look back on us? Will they say that we dealt with a moral and technological challenge of our time?

While discussions of political solutions to climate change are beginning to circulate, we can continue with our own personal efforts to reduce our individual carbon footprints. This Valentine's Day, rather than focusing on those red and chocolate filled aisles, why not look outside the box and give a gift that will truly make a difference.
The USDA is the agency tasked with enforcing the AWA at facilities that conduct biomedical research; therefore, if these same animals were used in a laboratory for human health research they would be protected under this federal law.

Investment in beyond-the-grid clean energy has been growing steadily, albeit with the world's foremost development institution, the World Bank, missing in action.

Over the past 8 years at least 660 million sharks have been slaughtered. That's enough to fill the entire 103-story Empire State Building with dead shark bodies 18 times, or, one building every 20 days, each year. That means at least 90 percent of sharks globally were poached in all oceans.



Without a radiograph machine, determining if bones are broken on a bird the size of a robin is a real challenge, but Melanie is an expert. Mary held the bird while Melanie gently palpated the bones of the wings, spine and legs. To her relief, no fractures presented.
Governor Brown is taking important steps to reduce the demand for fossil fuels. But that's only half of the equation. California also must urgently tackle the supply side, by committing now to keeping the critical carbon reserves of the state in the ground.
There is a misconception of sustainability as solely an ecological related subject, which is not the case. On the contrary, there are a range of definitions and applications.
It's possible for people and wildlife to thrive side by side on the plains. The key is to work collaboratively with everyone who has a stake in this precious resource, from ranchers to nomadic herdsmen, from energy companies to government policy-makers.
Speaking before a packed auditorium at London's Imperial College last week, Sir David King, the UK's former head scientist, and current envoy for climate change, described 2015 as \a seminal year\ for the planet.



About a month ago, I adopted a dog. Now -- a month later -- I'm still rescuing that dog. Bambi, my beautiful two-year-old pup, is a Pit Bull mix. I was ready for the wide array of problems new rescues often have. What I was not expecting, and what I was not ready for, was The Great Pit Bull Bias.
The disconnect between where the scientific community is on the causes of climate change, and what Congress thinks, is profound. Congress is also out of step with the American public.
We should better appreciate our avian species and other wildlife diversity around us. We are learning more and more about the origins of our natural world and the interrelationships that collectively provide the essence of life on earth.

A 2.0 utility business model that doesn't accommodate this opportunity for local, equitable access to energy production and management will leave many U.S. electricity consumers deeply unsatisfied.

If the United States and other nations do not fully ban the sale of ivory, African elephants could be extinct -- poof -- in as few as five years.
Finally an ad that shows the truth about breeding.  Animal advocates are protesting this?  They should have produced it.
San Juan, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Why not a Commonwealth of Texas? That thought occurred to me reading about political stalemate in Washington while celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the Sierra Club's vibrant chapter here.


Because of the likelihood that a large fraction of today's known fossil-fuel reserves will become \stranded,\ fossil fuels no longer represent safe investments. Thus, continued reliance on fossil fuels is neither safe environmentally nor safe economically.
If McDonald's really cares about the average American, as it purports to in its ads, how about some real transparency that makes it so \every-man\ has more information about what he (or she) is eating?
Bar the standard dinner party no-go areas of sex, religion and politics climate change doesn't follow far behind on the list of topics that might get you un-invited from the next social gathering.
Having a policy and enforcing the policy are two totally different and separate things. After all, law without enforcement is no law at all.
Going meatless may be an ethical choice, environmental, or maybe it's about wellness, \but it can also be delicious. I believe that,\ says Page. \Ultimately, it gets down to pleasure. And flavor.\
BP acted with gross negligence in precipitating the April 20, 2010 spill, Barbier ruled last September.  This mid-January, he found that BP wasn't grossly negligent or reckless in its source-control efforts to stop the spill.



A \Power India\ initiative would coordinate bilateral support from agencies such as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), U.S. Export-Import Bank, and USAID, with the goal of unlocking much needed support for clean energy projects and catalyzing the expansion of beyond-the-grid solar markets to help alleviate energy poverty.
The total area of American lawns is approximately 50 thousand square miles, about the size of New York State. To keep it well watered takes about 200 gallons per person per day, and nearly a third of all residential water use goes toward landscaping, according to the EPA.

In votes Wednesday on amendments to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline bill, some Republican Senators finally went on record acknowledging that man-made climate change is real. But it is clear that the Republican leadership and most members of their caucus still have no plans to do something about it.
I hope that the private sector will build and expand on the significant commitments already made to achieve these supply chains.
Many of us, like me, who live in the western United States know that one big thunderstorm isn't going to solve the problem.
It doesn't matter where the oil comes from, it doesn't matter where it goes, and it doesn't matter if it hurts the U.S. economy or not. They just hands-down love oil.
Instead of protecting it, the Queensland and Australian federal government have traded the crown jewel of the Seven Wonders of the World for exporting more heat-trapping gas and coal and more poisonous mercury vapor.


Like objects in a passenger-side mirror, the tipping point for pricing carbon is a lot closer than it appears, and votes this week in the Senate moved it a bit closer.
Of course, we shouldn't over-state the good news. Only half the Senate was willing to say human activities were a \significant\ cause of climate change, and actual plans to limit carbon pollution are sure to be under assault in the days ahead.
President Obama's State of the Union focuses on climate change; Republicans' sneaky move to give the Keystone XL pipeline a new name; Yellowstone River pipeline spill spews oil and cancer-causing benzene; PLUS

Every day factory farms and the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center inflicts shocking cruelties on animals. They don't want to have to modify their production methods one bit or give the animals even a few inches of extra space or a quick death.

Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia all use different economic, environmental and political instruments to achieve their climate goal but have helped Canada lower GHG emissions over the years and tackle climate change at the national level.
Limiting the pollution that causes climate change by getting us away from coal burning power plants and moving us towards a clean energy future is a critical step in tackling this crisis and the problems that come with it.
Nicole Hernandez Hammer will be sitting in the First Lady's box as President Obama delivers his sixth State of the Union address. To me, this signals the president's commitment to doing all he can to tackle the dangerous problem of climate pollution. And so I am celebrating.
The Supreme Court did more than open the door to the undoing of democracy in Citizens United. They also opened a potential floodgate of new chemical health threats backed by unbridled chemical industry spending.
California's multi-year drought grew dire enough in 2014 to prompt Governor Jerry Brown to declare a drought emergency in January. By the end of the year, California had experienced the driest and hottest 36 months in its 119-year instrumental record.
Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.
Let's all work together to make this practice a relic of the past, but we can't pretend that taking the lives of homeless pets when alternatives exist to save them is anything other than killing.


The fact is all of us depend on healthy natural systems for our prosperity, our progress, our very existence. The state of those systems is imperiled. We need our political leaders in Washington to help create a more promising future for our children, not put it at greater risk.



This long-running record heat contributes to an expensive \new normal\ for global businesses and national economies, raising the cost due to shifting weather patterns and more extreme heat waves, storms and droughts that can be fueled by a changing climate.
New comprehensive analysis from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication reveals a growing divide within the Republican Party over climate change.
One prime example of how little importance is given to the Florida environment is happening in Miami-Dade County -- home to Miami and 2.6 million residents.



As the Republican Party assumes control of Congress, one of their top priorities is to roll back the Obama administration's recent advances in energy and climate policy.




But when the tide comes, Shakespeare is right - you must seize it.  This is time for boldness, a time for vision, and a time above all to concentrate our strength and effort where we can move big ideas and game changing projects. Slow and steady won't win this race.
The Keystone XL vote is just the first in what the Republican Congressional leadership has promised will be a series of attacks on our health and environment. It is more important than ever that the Administration move forward with its clean power pla.





Polluters are fighting hard to get Keystone approved. The oil and gas industry pumped $53.1 million into last year's congressional campaigns--87 percent of which went to Republican candidates. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raked in $608,000 from the industry for his 2014 campaign, and now he is putting Keystone XL at the heart of his big polluter agenda. But this isn't just a battle over industry influence. This is a choice about the kind of nation we want to live in. Do we want to live in a country where expert reviews don't matter and industry profits trump our families' health? Do we want to lock ourselves into a fuel that generates 17 percent more climate change pollution than crude oil and makes our children more vulnerable to extreme weather? Or do we want something better?
We don't have to choose between clean air and a strong economy. We do have a right to clean, healthy air -- and our children have the right to skip, run, and play outside without breathing dangerous levels of smog.


Americans, according to a recent Pew poll, are the most worried they've been about Islamic extremism since 2007. But what boggles the mind is that fewer than half name climate change as a potential threat. This is disturbing.
Only time will tell if millennials will change the ways governments look at climate change. If the present is any reflection of the future, then yes, they will bring change. But if the American people know one thing it is that those we elect to represent us so often fall into other ways of thinking.
While political and business interests in Alaska are likely to oppose such new federal marine protections, it is important to note that federal waters off Alaska are co-owned an co-managed by all Americans, and all Americans have a say in their management.

The Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is not a jobs program. It is not an economic development program. It brings risk to our farmers in the heartland and the health of communities across the country threatened by climate change. It is time to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline once and for all.
2014 was a year of significant progress for the environment. To be sure, we still face plenty of very daunting challenges (you know the list). But there was also a lot of very significant progress to celebrate. Around the world, governments, businesses, nonprofits, and communities successfully came together to protect nature in a big and powerful way.
Many of the creatures have become threatened with extinction in the wild, with lions, tigers, and elephants being cases in point. Humanity has a moral obligation to preserve to the best of its ability the biodiversity of the planet.
Australians love the environment and they clearly understand the importance of protecting our life support system -- the oceans.



It turns out that the industry is right
The ruling for Sandra could open the doors for major changes in the treatment of animals in zoos, circuses, theme parks, and research facilities. The recognition of her rights  by the Argentinian court shows it's time our own legal system caught up.
The cost of building new conventional generators is astronomical. If you get a jump on this and find a way to make it profitable, fields of opportunity will open as other coal-fired plants shut down. And you just might blaze a trail toward a carbon-neutral future.

I can't think of a better place to recover than on a stretch of the Arkansas River renowned for its prized trout fishing and incredible whitewater rafting.
Well, 2014 was certainly the \Year That Was\ for parks and open space, with many cities finding places to build new parks by creatively reusing abandoned or underperforming infrastructure as parks, and with record levels of new public and private investment in some states and cities.

The golden age of agriculture is over. Growth based on the expansion of cropland area as seen until the 1950s, followed by improving land productivity through new technologies and productivity-based agricultural policies will fail us.
I'm pretty sure that Inhofe must be reading different news feeds than I am, otherwise, how could he fail to be as concerned as I am? Below are some of my top anxieties, not necessarily in order of my angst:
The \non-target\ costs of spraying lethal poisons in the environment are often high. In a cotton field, everything but the bugs feeding on cotton is non-target

We don't want to be blamed for unleashing economic activity that environmentally desecrates the most biologically diverse island in the Caribbean.
Our natural world, so wondrous and so valuable to the quality of our lives and to the integrity of our breathing planet, needs a renewed commitment to its conservation.

While these laws won't keep all puppy mill puppies out of New York City pet stores, it's a critical step in the right direction. Taken together they will deeply impact the lives of dogs in puppy mills across the nation, and further New York City's reputation as a leader in animal welfare and safety.

Without a comprehensive approach, consumers, seafood businesses, fishermen and the oceans will still be at risk from seafood fraud and illegal fishing.

SeaWorld's value as a business on the stock market has gone way way down. Well, SeaWorld, now that we have your attention...
In New York State, at least, sanity has prevailed. By banning fracking, Governor Andrew Cuomo has acted to protect his state's citizens from a rapacious industry whose presence would inevitably result in significant health and environmental consequences.
When you spend all of your time on the ground, you learn that this approach is broken. We all want power in the hands of people today, not decades from now.
The environmental community has a communication problem. The problem lies neither with the validity of their facts and figures nor with the caliber of their experts. The problem is a failure to convey to the American people the relevance of the environment to their everyday lives.

A series of mobilizations involving civil disobedience, boycotts and creative community alternatives are being planned to lay the groundwork for the People's Global Climate Strike in December 2015 to coincide with the Paris UN Climate conference.
New Yorkers also have to keep up the pressure on Governor Cuomo to make New York State a leader in clean energy development and deployment -- and get economic growth into the areas that so desperately need it.

The greed and corruption of a small clique are now turning Sarawak's rainforests into a monoculture of oil palms and hydropower reservoirs. Lukas Straumann documents the local politics, international complicity and desperate resistance in the struggle over one of the world's last paradises.

Earth Accounting is the effort of a dedicated but as yet small group to create this real world activity accounting system and present it to people in a form useful to consumers who are responsible for 70 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Local GSAs will not only have to be put in place over the next couple years, they'll have to come up with plans, and, more importantly, adequate funding to carry out sustainable basin-wide management.
This holiday season, eBay's incoming CEO Devin Wenig can signal to customers, shareholders, and employees that eBay's commitment on climate is stronger than ever by dumping ALEC.
Plants harvest carbon dioxide from the air, and when we dump fossil fuel carbon into the atmosphere much of it runs through the world's food chains and into our bodies. You build most of your body from air and water, but to do this you need the help of plants.

Coal ash is toxic as a bad marriage, but here's the irony

Doug Peacock is considered by many veterans as the godfather of the modern movement to connect those who have been to war with the physical land they fought for when they come home.

The rapid expansion of palm oil plantations has been identified as a key threat to the survival of orangutans.
The agreement in Lima is a mixed bag, but the seeds for Paris agreement have been planted. It is a diverse group of plants and it will need to be watered and cultivated, but with the right gardeners it can grow stronger.

Over the past thirteen days world leaders and representatives from 195 countries, members of the business community, academics, NGOs, indigenous and grassroots organisations, a total of over 12,000 international visitors have descended on Lima.
Cutting the rate of warming by half is essential for adaptation. Leadership from heads of government and a plan of action for fast mitigation to complement the UN agreement can start to answer the legitimate demands of all citizens for their governments to avoid the irreversible climate crisis.

Governments and their negotiators gathered in Lima for the UN climate conference (COP 20) must produce a meaningful agreement that will save our planet from the devastating effects of climate disruption.
Representatives John Dingell, George Miller, and Henry Waxman are retiring. They surely deserve the rest, but -- oh! -- how the environmental community will miss having them in the House. With gratitude, we bid them a fond farewell.
Six months after leaving Istanbul, we reached the eastern coast of China, thus officially crossing Asia with our bicycles. In addition to making friends with farmers, yak herders, and businessmen, we've talked to people we've met along the way about climate change.
Many Christmas trees are fitted with water containers to keep them fresh. This water could contain fertilizer or become stagnant over time. Prevent your pet from drinking from the tree to avoid potential complications.
Whether we like it or not, consumerism shapes many aspects of our society. Put a little differently, the way we spend our money communicates our beliefs, values, and interests.

Without a doubt, the midterms were not good news for U.S. clean energy and climate action.
When I told some colleagues and friends about this study they were incredulous and aghast. Cloaked in a lab coat and under the guise of conservation biology, this egregious study raises serious questions about oversight and approval of lethal research involving wild animals.
By embracing the fight against climate change, we can help make the United States a leader in clean energy jobs and economic opportunity, as well as environmental protection.
There's a reason why a Dachshund kicked off the now widespread trend of Dogshaming. Why? Because Doxies are mutherpuppin' mischievous, naughty-minded dogs. And I will back this statement up 100% because I am the proud pup parent of a little weenie devil.
This woman of Lithuanian heritage has grown to become one of the greatest scientists and primatologists of the 20th century. Birut\u00e9 Mary Galdikas has spent more than 40 years living and studying the behaviour of orangutans inside the once pristine rainforest of Borneo, Indonesia.

National and state-level polls tell us that, once people understand how fracking affects our groundwater, air quality, and climate, opposition to it rises. In this case, knowledge really is power as we push back against the polluters.
Part 2 of this three-part series concerning America's first offshore wind farm was an October interview with Cape Wind's Communications Director Mark Rodgers. Rodgers recently recalled the significance of Massachusetts's original windmills to the early economy of Cape Cod:

There are the obvious daily habits such as diet, exercise, and social activities that ensure good health, but what about the things we don't always think about? The less obvious areas of impact on our health include our homes, offices, and the built environment around us.
I fear that the dubious claims by this latest report simply complicate prospects for having the very important and necessary conversation about what measures California will need to take to deal with what is likely to be a steadily worsening water crisis. That is no small matter.
In the 21st century, \show me the bodies\ seems like a cruel and outdated foundation for public policy.  Yet history is littered with examples -- like tobacco and asbestos -- where only after the death toll mounts is the price of inaction finally understood to exceed that of action.
We are not taking urgent action. Nature does not negotiate, it responds to our intransigence. For the people of the Philippines, and in many other parts of the world, climate change is already a catastrophe.

The Sierra Club believes that all people deserve a healthy planet with clean air and water and a stable climate. All people also deserve equal protection under the law and the right to live their lives free of discrimination and hatred. These issues are not separate.
Climate action is economically good and patriotic
Citizens of the Ocean is a socially-driven movement, a growing network of informed individuals motivated by a love of the ocean and an understanding that global connection is a powerful way to defend and sustain the ocean. We are joined together against the bankrupt values of the past and united as a force for the future.

The program is a winner. Congress should support the loan program or, even better, create a long-term, self-sustaining, energy infrastructure bank modeled on the very program some once mistakenly attacked.
Attorneys representing Denton, Texas, the first city to ban hydraulic fracturing (\fracking\) in state history, have issued rebuttals to the two lawsuits filed against Denton the day after the fracking ban was endorsed by voters on election day.
Birds may be just one canary in the climate change \mine.\ They are important signals of not only environmental disruption, but also of risks to humans.




The world is outraged by Japan's latest shameful act of stealing an albino dolphin from the sea and its proposed sale, which sentences this exquisite apex predator to a heinous life of slavery.
In fact, in late November of this year, an early arctic weather pattern turned the Midwest cold and windy - the perfect ingredients for iced lighthouses on the Great Lakes. When I arrived at the lighthouse, my expectations were correct. This was the earliest I can remember, where the outer lighthouse in St. Joseph, Michigan was completely covered in ice. As a rule, mid to late December is the typical time for icing -cold, windy, and the lake is still liquid.  Any later, and Lake Michigan tends to freeze over, and the splashing and spray are suppressed, so the lighthouses don't ice up.
The opportunities to harness tropical forests as nature's climate change solution are essential and immediately available, but disappearing. We must act now.
Why not invest in a new society that's safer and fairer, that reduces the threats posed by hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos?
Humans' most common pastime -- forsaken for decades as too slow and too much effort -- is now recognized as a health breakthrough, an economic catalyst and a route to happiness.
We know we should be trying to save the ancient ecosystems that support over half of all wildlife on earth. But how much do we actually understand this? How much do we fully grasp the magnitude of what will actually happen when the last of the forests vanish for good?
Solar energy access in the United States varies wildly from state to state. Texas gets enough sunlight per year to power the entire world via solar energy, and yet has one of the lowest solar capacities in the country. At the heart of it is state-level regulatory policy.
I know there's a big wide world spinning around us filled with famine and war and suffering and poverty, and real problems. But that didn't stop me from turning into a living, breathing clich\u00e9 as I stood there in the middle of our suburban street while out for a walk with my daughter, sobbing uncontrollably because my cat died.
On November 21, 2014, the Board of Trustees of American University voted in favor of supporting climate destruction, refusing to divest its $550 million endowment from the fossil fuel industry and placing American University firmly on the wrong side of history.
Is it a bit much to say that we are in the midst of a Food Revolution? I suggest that depends on how you view the current conditions on your plate, in your family, in your community, in our nation.








There's a lot to be thankful for -- from historic progress on climate to groundbreaking environmental laws that can serve as a model for the rest of the nation. Behind each of these accomplishments was grassroots activism, engaged citizens, and committed individuals who just didn't give up; and it's that kind of people power that I'm most grateful for this holiday season.
It's Saturday morning in Plympton, Mass., and the sun has yet to dry the dew from the windows at the Mayflower Cranberries farm, but owner Jeff LaFleur is already on a knee in his bog inspecting his crimson bounty in preparation for the fall harvest.
Today, as Thanksgiving approaches and we reflect on what we are grateful for, thousands are taking to Twitter to celebrate the climate movement with a simple message rarely heard in this doom and gloom issue
While the Tour de Turtle race is over for this year, the issues of protecting endangered sea turtles is a year-round concern and one that individuals and the tourism industry can do much to assist with.
With their longstanding allies now in Senate leadership, big polluters will seek to load up must-pass spending bills with anti-environmental riders and pass stand alone bills to block or overturn hard-fought safeguards.
Made by the director of Food Inc., and based on the remarkable book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway, Merchants of Doubt shows exactly how a small, well-trained group of PR people crafted a massive campaign to confuse Americans about climate change.
In just four years, bike share has gone from being the fantasy of a few enthusiasts to a practical and low-cost way for tens of thousands of people in American cities, both large and small, to get around.
If Senator Thune actually believed what scientists and the U.S. military tells us about our dire climate future, he would be compelled to act immediately and with force. He'd have to stop pushing for the Keystone XL pipeline and questioning the economic impact of climate change solutions.
Perhaps this roadmap can be viewed as our own personal outline for what all of us as a society can do to improve honey bee health but only when we know how the major players of the bee food chain interact and the knowledge we already know or have access to.
There is a particular moment in the mountains, when the clouds part and mysterious summits are revealed, that I find especially appealing. Often, muted gray skies and low clouds obscure the world above, leaving steep ridges disappearing into an atmospheric abyss.
If China seizes the opportunity to learn from the ports on the other side of their most valuable trade route, they can boost their economy, improve public health and help to solve the world's most pressing environmental issues all at once.
One of the greatest injustices of climate change is that those who have done the least to cause it -- like the residents of the Philippines hit by Super Typhoon Yolanda -- feel the impacts first and worst through rising sea levels and extreme weather.












The ocean was still a great unknown in the years between the world wars, and some scientists speculated that the bottom was a \dead zone\ where the pressure and darkness made life impossible. It was in this atmosphere of total uncertainty that William Beebe and Otis Barton built a hollow steel ball called the Bathysphere.
Since 2012, Rosie and Opal -- a pair of middle-aged, retired circus elephants -- had been living at Hope Elephants, a facility in Hope, Maine. But Rosie and Opal's storyline took an unexpected turn.


We decided to ask our pawsome followers over on Facebook what other things Pit Bull parents are sick and tired of hearing from people, and these were the results.
So what would happen if Keystone XL is built? The U.S. State Department estimates Keystone XL could spill up to 100 times during its lifetime.
Her cultured nut products -- Schinner's term, which is accurate if not romantic -- reflect that ethos. Meatless since the age of twelve, she loved cheese, especially the rich, ripe cheeses she enjoyed traveling around Europe.
Last week, we recognized some of the most remarkable people and animals on the front lines of that effort by bestowing our annual ASPCA Humane Awards.
This bill would bypass essential reviews, skip safety assessments, and fast track a dangerous project. This has sweeping implications for future generations. And yet it is entangled in the politics of the moment.


Most conservation practitioners would rather spend the next dollar raised on reducing threats than monitoring the effectiveness of their actions. Not surprisingly, few have ever attempted to gather scientifically credible data on any of the numerous exhaustive lists of indicators.

TransCanada's fight, and the Keystone XL pipeline, might be moot -- along with the campaign that brought together a broad coalition of environmental groups working to block the project and contain the import of tar-sands oil.
This week's court decision shows that India's democracy is indeed robust. The system of checks and balances, of which the courts are a part, is capable of surviving harsh political environments and delivering justice.




None of us like to think of our beloved dogs getting hurt, but it's always better to be prepared in case something does go wrong. Many people already have a first aid kit at home for the humans, but what about the four-legged members of the family?
More than 40 years ago, my then-wife Nigey Lennon and I were on our way home to Echo Park when, suddenly, she said to stop. I thought it was because she'd spotted a garage sale. Instead it was a woman who had set up a bunch of cages with cockatiels for sale.

How quickly can the shift to renewables and de-carbonization at the source be achieved through individual and grass roots efforts? Globalization is the reality and events like the 'Voices of Hope in a Time of Crisis' Conference are themselves the products of globalization.





A state legislative committee chaired by Sierra Club champion Sen. Don Harmon officially unleashed fracking in Illinois today, approving the final regulatory rules in secret, as legislators essentially dumped the concerns of compromising lobbyists with the Illinois Environmental Council and Sierra Club in closed-door meetings.


When the world's major financial institutions start to do serious, accurate, research science and measure the declining costs of renewable energy verse the rising costs of fossil fuels, it becomes easier to understand the monumental impact that the Green Industrial Revolution is having.

Ecological debt has transcended the physical and political boundaries of any individual nation to become a global phenomenon that involves every person on earth in the calculating and recalculating the sums through collective and individual behaviors worldwide.

Although the Minamata Convention constitutes a significant leap for protecting people and nature against the dangers of mercury, the real work begins now. We have confidence that the November gathering in Bangkok will represent the first great call for concrete global action.

Ari Phillips at Climate Progress. Three major companies - Cisco Systems, 3M, and Kimberly Clark - announced they will now give employees a deeply discounted way of buying or leasing solar panels for their homes. Sunny news, indeed!






Last Halloween, if you wanted to hand out tiger-friendly treats, you had precious few options. Fast forward twelve months, and it's a heck of a lot easier to find a treat that isn't tricking the Sumatran tigers and orangutans out of their homes.
That we have been sleepwalking through such massive destabilization for decades proves that we are much better at consensually hallucinating than we are at separating our sciences and fictions.
We will never win the war on poaching unless we get the Asian demand countries on side through education and legislation; however, that will take patience and a whole lot of political will, and in the meantime Africa's wildlife is haemorrhaging.
Even if you are not prepared to vote for them next Tuesday, you should take time out to thank our political leadership for getting this one right, and learn what needs to be done in your community and how you can help.   Long Island -- for future generations.
There is no single fix that can make our region more resilient in the face of climate change. But by working in our communities and at the national level, we can defuse this threat. Here are six areas where additional attention is greatly warranted.
The term 'wealth inequality' is thrown around in a lot of abstract ways. Here's to making it concrete:Imagine the makers of one of humanity's highest-grossing entertainment films shooting footage for the sequel at one of the world's most brutal sites of human and environmental abuse.
With all the news about population, extinction and climate change, it can feel pretty apocalyptic out there. But we can still choose not to be zombies.

As if it isn't bad enough that the Canadian seal hunt is the largest slaughter of marine animals in the world, now Canada is the only country still allowing polar bears to be hunted for their skins and body parts.
BP has argued that, since total flow rate was never measured we have no way of calculating the volume. To this day the company disputes the US government's estimate of 4.2 million barrels spilled into the Gulf, arguing that it was half that.


The actions that will address the climate crisis will largely take place within nation-states, and for reasons that are only indirectly related to climate change.
After decades of suburban sprawl, we're finally on a more urban trend in the US.  That's a very good thing, but it's easy to forget as we add more urban development to our cities that we humans are biophilic creatures.
If this game-changing goal is widely adopted by the environmental community and by a vanguard of public officials, it would put California climate policymakers and others under pressure to advance the state's already ambitious clean energy goals.
Right now, clean energy access providers are getting hit both coming and going. Their competitors -- fossil fuel companies -- are highly subsidized, but clean energy companies are taxed.


It is about time for Congress to address the issue and pass legislation that provides an innovative approach to both mitigating and adapting to climate change. Ignorance, benign neglect and self-interest need to be overcome. That is what leadership is all about.
A huge gulf exists in farmer attitudes toward science. Growers clearly accept the scientific evidence that modified food is safe while rejecting the scientific evidence that climate change is real and caused by human activity. And this chasm is driven by simple economics. One finding makes farmers money, but the other doesn't -- yet.





The beautiful thing is that if we take care of our waterways, they will take care of us. A cleaner river and more vibrant ecosystem are powerful resources. They provide numerous education opportunities and drive community well-being and engagement.
Retailers have historically been, and continue to be, a critical part of the Right to Know Movement. So the next time you see your local store's shelves stocked with non-GMO options, remember to thank that retailer for helping to make a difference in the future of our food system.

I'm done fighting with Mother Nature. Someday I hope to afford professional landscapers who are more equipped to fight off vermin and don't take it personally.
The USS America is the latest evidence that our military sees the connection between energy and effectiveness.
The claims coming from the mouths of our elected representatives showcase an incredibly wide array of pseudo-scientific criticism directed at the contemporary understanding of climate change.
Sheen joins Brigitte Bardot, Bob Barker, Steve Irwin and Sam Simon in an elite class of Hollywood stars, conservationists and television executives who support Sea Shepherd and have vessels named in their honor

We are heading toward a potentially severe clash between environmentalists who advocate for reducing carbon emissions and community and labor activists who are most concerned about jobs, racial equity, and reducing wealth inequality.
Water problems are a complex mix of natural resource, technology, social, economic and political conditions. When water is limited during extreme events such as droughts, society puts in place a variety of responses. But many of the actions taken in recent years have actually increased the vulnerability of other systems.
Mainstream reporting lately gives a pass to the pesticide industry that pours millions into lobbying government and media elites and defeating voter ballot initiatives to require labeling of GMO foods.

If constructed, the facility could see some six to eight million tons of coal and refinery waste exported overseas every year (that's about six coal-fired power plants worth of coal).
So, let me present the who's who of climate pollution, as if the offenders were characters on a certain beloved TV show from the 80s (and blockbuster movie from a few years ago).
The oil industry may feel entitled to its potential profits, and will likely fight efforts to curb extreme well stimulation and enhancement anywhere they appear. But the people of California and New York -- indeed of all of states -- are even more entitled to clean air and clean water.


Research out of UC Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara is providing evidence that a decline in animals actually means that our social structures are crumbling.



We should focus on these \climate opportunities\ in addition to the \climate hotspots\ -- the areas that the models show will be adversely impacted.

let us be horrified by the criminal and indeed unconscionable mistreatment of against animals that occurred at Foster Farms recently. But let us also remember that mistreatment is occurring on a much broader scale in the meat industry.

What if humanity actually committed itself, at the level of a national government, to learning from and working with nature? What if environmentalism didn't mean (only) marching in the streets, pumping one's fists or chaining oneself to a tree?








Who, among those with an inkling of the climate disaster already upon millions of beings on the planet, could not be heartened by the numbers, commitment, creativity, energy, joy, and diversity involved in Sunday's protests? The movement showed itself to be... a movement.


Head in the sand doesn't solve the climate change issue. It's time to face it with all that it takes.
Understanding the interconnections and interdependence needed for a healthy planet to live and the global and collective work needed to fix the damage done is not just a backyard issue, but rather an LGBTQ one, too.

Cape Wind Communications Director Mark Rodgers reflects on the leadership required to move the project from drawing board to construction. He explains how the un-calculated or \external\ costs of polluting sources of energy have inspired communities to support renewable sources of power.
In what can only be described as a terrifying ordeal, monkeys are subjected to horrendous conditions including unfamiliar noise, inadequate food and water supplies, poor ventilation and temperature extremes. Having first been either ripped violently from the wild or bred in terrible foreign breeding facilities, their journey only ends in hell.
These decisions are crucial to those who live in nearby communities, hunt and fish and camp on public lands, cherish and record the vast archeological resources hidden there, or make their living ranching or outfitting on public lands.
I'm no journalist, but for those who missed the significance of this singular moment due to the mainstream media's abdication of responsibility, permit me a few reflections on why the PCM was monumental.
Climate change is already a planetary crisis that, if unchecked, will undermine our health, our economy, our environment, and our food supplies. The nation deserves more ambitious, not to mention consistent, leadership from the President.
The recent March of official representatives of many different countries (People's Climate March) on climate change through New York, for the United Nations General Assembly, shining in the media spotlight, provided an ideal opportunity.
More than $100 trillion in public and private spending could be saved between now and 2050 if the world were to expand public transportation, walking and bicycling in cities, according to a new report.
Whether or not you have ever eaten a piece of Antarctic fish or a krill oil dietary supplement, this spectacular place is meaningful to your life. The stark beauty of its land and sea matter to us, as do the lives of the iconic animals that call it home.
We wanted to show that we are still in peril, but more, we have the means to solve our problems in the present. There are many reasons to be optimistic and hopeful.

The African elephant population has decreased by more than 60 percent over the past decade.  Just in the past three years, ivory-seeking poachers have killed more than 100,000 elephants.

Stopping the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline makes a difference for communities in Nebraska and along the pipeline pathway. Real jobs are stake, jobs on many farms and ranches. Those are the jobs that drive this region and feed the country.

Thanks to the epic success of the People's Climate March, alarm bells demanding climate action have never rung louder. So, now that you've succeeded in elevating the mother of all issues to the top of the global agenda, where should you and your fellow 399,999 marchers direct your tide-turning energies?
The soaring demand for products derived from wildlife has pushed several iconic species --including elephants, rhinos, and tigers, as well as many lesser known species -- toward the precipice of extinction. This is a global crisis for both wildlife and people, particularly local communities.

Our sustainable tourism class this week celebrated World Tourism Day with listening to World Tourism day messages, and a good discussion on the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism.


On September 21, I was present at a piece of history...the People's Climate March of 2014. It was a huge event, planned with precision, and broken down into six contingencies. The route covered two miles. My interviews began with people waiting for the bus, on their way to the west side of Manhattan.
Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded. California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a package of bills to promote more CA electric cars, while New York Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled plans for $1 billion in energy retrofits for municipal buildings and pressuring landlords into reducing energy use.

When I was born in an Indigenous Limbu village of Eastern Nepal, no one had heard of climate change. It was impossible, then, for anyone in the village to imagine that I might one day speak at the United Nations during a Climate Summit.

Leaders from many faiths, religions, and wisdom traditions made it clear that climate change presents a spiritual crisis, not just an economic and political debate. Our conversations included dialogue with UN leaders on how to reverse the dangerous direction the world is still taking.
It was fitting that New York hosted the recent UN climate change summit for several reasons. Let's start with the old joke about the guy who jumps off the Empire State Building and, as he passes the 50th floor on this way down, is heard to say \so far so good.\
While historically it has been difficult to regulate these harmful chemicals today we can create best practices to work towards preventing this from ever happening again in any school.
When sitting in close proximity to a group of elephants, it always amazes me how small an elephant's tusks are relative to its body. Certainly far less than a hundredth of its weight. But because of these tusks -- their teeth -- tens of thousands of elephants die each year.

We demand an energy transformation that will ban new dirty energy projects and transition towards accessible, democratic, sustainable and clean energy that is community-based and managed, and publicly controlled.
Ecosystem-based fisheries management may sound complex, but there are concrete, cost-effective steps to make it a reality, including conserving habitat where fish spawn and protecting food sources for fish.
In order to become once again the owners of our destiny and future, we must implement a profound transformation of thought
The climate movement must stand up to the free trade rules and ideology that helped get us into this climate mess and that will thwart our ability to solve it and say, \enough is enough.\
Among the blizzard of announcements made as part of the UN Climate Summit over the past few days, one that should not be lost in the storm is the pledge made by French President Francois Hollande to contribute $1 billion to the new Green Climate Fund.
At a certain point, we will discover ourselves unable to outlaw or repent or pray away the carbon dioxide and methane blanketing the planet. If that time comes, no change of mind or heart or law will be able to derail our rendez-vous with catastrophe.
Is Xcel billing ratepayers for the cost of attacking ratepayers who go solar?
While our attention is focused on projects like Keystone XL, Big Oil is developing big plans to send Alberta's bitumen east through Quebec, where the clock is ticking on a new climate bomb.
Last Sunday, I had the pleasure of joining around 400,000 people in New York to express the urgent need for meaningful climate action.
We're the first generation to witness the real devastation of climate change. We may be the last generation capable of curbing it.
At last week's New York unveiling of the mounted body of Lonesome George, the legendary Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, the VIPs in attendance dismissed it as a silly idea

Somewhere scattered in that long rope of humanity were over 300 Minnesotans like myself, who endured a 24-hour bus ride (twice!) to 'walk the talk' that the reality of climate change requires immediate and meaningful action.
House Republicans have not only stymied congressional action to stop dangerous climate change by opposing every forward-thinking policy, but they have repeatedly tried to roll back the landmark Clean Air Act, which enabled President Obama to put forward an executive branch Climate Action Plan.
The People's Climate March will hopefully set some official pants on fire and speed up the capitalization of the new fund. At the same time, we need to be vigilant that the powers that be don't abuse the GCF as honey pots from which they can fund business-as-usual or outright destructive projects.
These people showed up on our behalf and I was moved by their efforts. Maybe, if we all showed up for the really important problems in our world we could see some of the change we want. We would see some of the change we all need.
Those just passing through can't possibly comprehend how serious we are about preserving what is lovely, and restoring what has been defiled. But little do those passing through know, either, of the rising threat to these treasures that define us as The Garden State.
The bottom line is clear
The bloody \War Against Nature\ is raging across the Australian continent. The largest land predator, a 55-pound free-ranging dog, called a dingo (classified as a subspecies of grey wolf) is in deep trouble.
From Rio to Paris to Istanbul to Durban to Seoul, city mayors are already making great progress in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and minimizing climate risks.
It's time to shift the paradigm on urban development. But this is only truly possible through strong leadership and real commitments to make the change a reality. Let's hope leaders seize the opportunities today to shape more sustainable, prosperous cities of the future.
Voting is our right, but it is also our responsibility. Because if we don't take the next step and elect leaders who are committed to building a better future for our kids, other rights -- our rights to clean air, clean water, health and prosperity -- are placed directly in harm's way.


Facing one of the most under-reported climate disasters in the nation, residents on the frontlines of extraction in the Shawnee forests of southern Illinois joined climate marchers from around the globe today with their own message of hope and struggle.
I have long understood that climate change is not only an environmental issue--it is a humanitarian, economic, health, and justice issue as well. Today's march reflected all those concerns.

Fashion matters. As we approach a series of crunch talks for the planet on environmental issues pertaining to climate change, beginning with UN talks in New York, I want to say this loud and proud.
If we are to keep global warming within the manageable limits of 2 degrees Celsius by 2012, we need to speak up with a clear, strong, united voice -- now.


As a climate and Earth science communicator, I find this is the biggest challenge. We're in a constant fight to capture attention, to move people, to make them care about how their behavior is affecting Earth.\n\nTo feel something.
Will we leave the children we love a safer, healthier planet than the one that was handed off to us?  Will they breathe clean air, swim in the ocean, find jobs in healthy communities and a healthy economy? This is why we march.
Above all, it is clarity, not complexity, that companies need -- which is why in addition to putting a price on carbon, BT supports a carbon labelling scheme for electricity, as one solution that would reward businesses for using low carbon and renewable energy.
Across the globe, we've loaded the atmosphere with so much pollution from burning fossil fuel that the climate is warming up everywhere, and our weather and climate is changing to a \new normal.\ The conditions we were used to are a thing of the past, and this is especially true for the southwestern states.
We need to stop ever more costly and risky extraction from places such as deepwater sites or the Arctic. We need to stop granting subsidies for fossil fuels - something that many of our governments have committed to do but have yet to put into practice.
The climate movement is home to quite a few who go the full-on vegan, composting, skip-coffee-because-it's-bad-for-the-climate route. But going green is only good if it actually gets somewhere.


Our report highlights 33 species -- but it could easily have included thousands more. From giant blue whales and mysterious Antarctic toothfish to furry Weddell Seals and rugged chinstrap penguins, the Southern Ocean is part of a vast interconnected ocean environment that not only supports marine life but human life around the world.
I invite you to join the crowds in New York or in your city at the historic People's Climate March this Sunday -- or else try any number of these five ways to join the march in spirit, and speak out beyond this weekend to save our planet.
Our leaders aren't just dithering at the edges while the planet burns -- they're actively inviting the very companies that are causing this crisis to help fix it.




I'm a New Yorker. Living in NY is what I can speak from the heart about. We're a tough bunch and along with the rest of the world, we're taking a beating from climate change. Here's why I am marching to protect what I love, my New York.
The idea of branding climate change could seem like another exercise in navel-gazing unless you consider the effectiveness of the opposition. They've got branding down, relentlessly repeating the mantra, \science is inconclusive and solutions are exorbitant and unproven.\
Young people play a vital role in fighting climate change
I used to be one of those people who didn't understand the threat of climate change. I wondered, \Why should global warming matter to me?\ When I learned what a warmer world would look like -- especially for people of color and low-income communities -- I was terrified.


In a continent where dogs are often regarded as food, a change in attitude is palpable as the science behind the healing powers of canine therapy is being embraced by animal lovers and doctors alike.
I always encourage my clients to look at their life from their dog's perspective. Many of my current complaints can be traced to the August to September transformation, with dogs suffering the worst bouts of anxiety and frustration when suddenly left alone.
To be truly effective and powerful, to have the social impact needed to reverse dangerous environmental trends impacting climate, ocean life, human life, forests, energy resources and all of Earth's ecosystems, collaboration and inclusion are essential.
Looking above at recent temperature anomalies, the jet stream has once again wobbled down into the US, bringing unusually cool but refreshing weather to much of the US as California and Alaska bake.


As more tourism businesses achieve certification that meets the GSTC standards, the industry will begin to become more sustainable. A good EMS will not only accelerate that process but will also be more likely to save the company money as well.
For me, however, and I suspect for many others, marching shoulder to shoulder with kindred spirits goes beyond the need to make a point. It is an expression of shared hope, reflecting deeply held convictions about the need to protect our children, our grandchildren and the generations to come.



I remember as a kid walking the fields with my grandfather. He said, \No man has the right to take more from the land than the land itself can withstand.\  That balanced approach made sense to me when I was six, and it still makes sense to me today.





This is why I joined with more than 200 health and well-being professionals in Utah to send a letter to President Obama asking him to protect Greater Canyonlands to foster a healthy America.

Chemical illnesses are the hidden cost of industry's rapid expansion across America. The medical community knows with certainty that people get sick when exposed to oil and petrochemicals, yet nothing is being done to protect our health.
My bet is that 2016 will be the last campaign in American history in which conservatives will reflexively ignore the economic interests of their voters by routinely attacking clean energy as a left-wing boondoggle.
The world is currently on track to heat up the climate by six degrees, which would cause huge losses to the global economy. In order to avoid this, significant investments in low-carbon technologies are needed. But where should the cash come from?
As the UN Climate Summit approaches and countries begin to reveal their reduction commitments for the 21st United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in 2015, all eyes are on the United States and President Obama.







For decades, cats have been routinely rounded up and killed in shelters as fall guys for bird population declines. But the real reason bird populations are suffering is the same reason salmon populations are struggling

However improbable it might have seemed twenty, five, or even two years ago, Detroit could well be on the verge of a major turnaround that could make it one of the biggest success stories in urban America over the next decade.
The military isn't going green for fun or for positive public relations -- they're doing it because it saves lives and money. The fact is, oil markets are global, no matter the origin of the product. This means, for every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, it costs the Department of Defense an additional $1.3 billion -- more than the entire procurement budget of the Marines.

The choices we make in our day-to-day life do matter and can play a major role in slowing climate change. Maybe it's time to reevaluate the food we're eating and make simple changes to fight for a healthy future.
Joan Rivers had a barbed tongue but she also had a soft spot for animals. Despite her penchant for wearing fur, Joan always appreciated PETA's efforts.

Hokule'a is a twin-hulled canoe, or vaka, based on the ancient design of open-ocean Polynesian voyaging canoes. Millennia ago, Polynesians sailed across thousands of miles of ocean and settled the many islands of the Pacific in canoes just like this.
Many consumers are under the generally false impression that adopting 'green' (i.e., energy efficient) technologies is beyond their financial reach. And especially during these economic hard times, even the suspicion that something will cost more is enough to deter its purchase.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again

The turbulent economics of low carbon energy are poised to ride roughshod over everyone's expectations and transform the conventional dynamics of climate policy. A phase shift is occurring -- and like a spring melt, what follows will be wild and unpredictable.



Although validating the legitimacy of a sustainability certification system is a huge task, the basic operations of such a system can assist in determining whether or not it will earn success and credibility in addressing the environmental and social issues it is taking on.

Have you noticed how laboratory-made cleaning fumes are marketed as being able to wipe out any offending bacteria or germ?  All you need to do is take a trip down the cleaning aisle of your local supermarket to see how many different products there are to choose from.
You don't have to go old school like me, though. Go for an abundance of whole grain products including cereals, pastas, pilafs, breads, muffins and more.



Looking above at recent temperature anomalies,  much of the US is cooler than normal, but the eastern Pacific warm spot continues to prevent much rain from reaching California, which is hotter than normal.

Earlier this month a tailings dam designed by Knight Piesold at the Mount Polley copper mine breached, dumping up to 10 million cubic meters of heavily contaminated water into surrounding streams, rivers and lakes in British Columbia. The plan for the Pebble mine in southwest Alaska calls for three earthen dams, all similar in design to the one that just broke.

For registered nurses the climate crisis is a clear and present public-health emergency as well as a creeping bomb for our planet -- and they draw a direct link between extreme forms of energy extraction and the horrific impacts they see on human health.


Drilling means spilling. True recovery after a devastating oil spill is a myth spun by Big Oil.

For a large number of SIDS, the first four days of September could become the launch pad for new sustainable development paths. With the proper support from donors and technical assistance agencies, the Samoa conference may very well be all that is needed to unleash the true potential of these global gems of the ocean world.


My long experience with pesticides, agriculture, and the environment has convinced me we must defang agriculture. Ban most of its biocides. Keep some pesticides for emergencies. But these chemicals are not necessary to produce food. Organic farming is a proof of that.
Most of us know a sustainabilly. The urban pickle canner, the suburban farmer, the home brewer, and the off-the-grid craftsman come to mind. However, I am finding that the term sustainabilly needs a bit of refinement in our modern age of specialization.
Love tuna? Well, it's pretty much extinct thanks to the insatiable human appetite for sushi. Scared of sharks? No problem, we've killed almost all of them.
The use of plastics in our daily lives has grown drastically over the last several decades. It is difficult for us to function without using plastics in some form. Think about our annual use of nearly 300 million metric tons.








How unusual has the weather been? No one event is \caused\ by climate change, but global warming, which is predicted to increase unusual, extreme weather, is having a daily effect on weather, worldwide.






In recent years, oil and gas developers have been agitating for the first new lease for off-shore drilling in California waters since before the Santa Barbara oil spill. And where the project would be located? You guessed it

A U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has ruled that Enbridge's 600-mile-long Flanagan South Pipeline, a Keystone XL \clone,\ is legally cleared to proceed opening for business in October.


The Aspen Art Museum in Colorado is hosting a controversial exhibit from Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang featuring three African sulcata tortoises, each affixed with a pair of iPads stuck directly to their massive shells.

It looks like the smart money in China has long realized what the data is now showing

In a recent quarter two call for investors, Enbridge Inc executives said the company's \Keystone XL\ clone -- the combination of the Flanagan South and Seaway Twin pipelines -- will open for business by October.
Of the 80,000-plus chemicals that have been approved to be on the market in the United States, approximately 17,000 are \secret.\ If you believe that our current laws and regulations protect you and your family from all these chemicals, you are mistaken.


Earlier this week the Barbuda Council signed into law a sweeping set of new ocean-management regulations that zone the coastal waters, strengthen fisheries management, and establish a network of marine sanctuaries.
In a beautiful new film released this Friday on Netflix, oceanographer and explorer Sylvia Earle describes her underwater adventures. She also explains why she is driven to protect wild oceans the way we now protect wild lands.


Still can't imagine a race in the L.A. River that doesn't involve cars, motorcycles and a film crew? Too strange to be true?  Here is more about the race from George Wolfe, the founder and president of L.A. River Expeditions, the event organizer.




It is particularly worrying that a previously leaked chapter of the TPP includes only very vague references to shark finning -- not the full ban on shark finning and associated trade that we need.
With so few opportunities left to maintain pristine wilderness on this planet, we must seize this chance or risk losing it forever.
There is weak international governance of our oceans. The fragmented nature of ocean governance is a challenge that needs to be overcome in order to protect sharks on the global scale.
In addition to committing to renewable energy and divesting from dirty fuels, colleges and universities can use their influence to advocate for statewide policies that will bring more clean energy online.
Each year, the lion's share of mercury poison comes from burning more than 8.3 billion tons of coal to provide energy for electricity grids. As a result of this insatiable addiction to coal, mercury toxicity has tripled in our oceans to over 80,000 tons of poison. Eighty-four percent of fish tested are laced with methyl-mercury.






World Elephant Day is recognized on August 12, an appeal to all global citizens to help conserve and protect elephants from the numerous threats they face. A few days after learning of the death of Satao I met up with beloved scientist and conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall to discuss the elephant crisis.
The verdict is in... again! Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen. This is not earthshaking news or even news, but apparently Congress felt it was worth a million of your tax dollars to confirm what has been a scientific fact for nearly a decade
Following in the footsteps of the chemical industry, the synthetic-biology industry is rushing its untested products to market before there is any regulation, oversight or even scientific understanding of the impacts this technology could have on ecosystems and human health.


All weather talk is good talk as far as I am concerned. It is also human talk. Checking the forecast on multiple platforms is an American pastime, but staying around to discuss the weather on any platform is a different thing altogether.
The effort to produce algae biofuels has been underway for many, many years, though you wouldn't know it given that there are still virtually none being produced at commercial scale. The hype about making \cheap, abundant fuels with nothing but sunlight and water\ remains in spite of the reality on the ground.
Can we truly speed up the world's transition to clean tech? Can America's splintered right and left find common ground on the climate debate? What is the best way forward for America to achieve energy security? Can the green sector really create jobs and economic opportunity?

We've learned that we cannot solve the climate crisis by staying at home -- we've got to get out, stand up and peacefully fight back. In our case, the target has been clear from the very beginning

It's not just dirty money that earns Congressman Shimkus today's Dirty Denier award, it's his opposition to reducing dangerous carbon pollution.
The Obama Administration's proposed regulation of existing power-sector sources of CO2 has the potential to be cost-effective, and if you accept these numbers, it can also be welfare-enhancing, if not welfare-maximizing.
Now that the \nuclear renaissance\ is dead following the Fukushima catastrophe, the nuclear corporations will not accept defeat. Their new strategy is to develop small modular reactors (SMRs), allegedly free of the dangers inherent in large reactors. But their claims are fallacious.




While it is great to see all these multinational palm oil producers making the pledge to protect forests for the sake of wild animals, how would one know at the retail level which products use palm oil from these producers?

With the current domestic natural gas boom serving as a bridge to this solar future, the United States has a chance to claim its role as a \solar superpower.\ But we must first recognize the need for a course correction in our industrial policy.
Although it's too late to prevent the current epidemic in West Africa, perhaps we can prevent another one if we take a moment to look at how Ebola and many other infectious diseases arrive on our doorstep in the first place
A hundred years ago we think there were over a million lions. When I was born, maybe 450,000 lions roamed these plains. Today we niggle over if there are 20,000 or 35,000 lions left and forget to look over our shoulders at history.
Even as the Environmental Protection Agency finally attempts to limit carbon dioxide pollution from coal plants, it is meeting resistance at the state level, thanks to a secretive campaign by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).
Our efforts aren't about shutting down debate. Quite the opposite. We're asking for a more robust debate that begins with an accurate accounting of the facts and greater accountability when things go wrong.


How unusual has the weather been? No one event is \caused\ by climate change, but global warming, which is predicted to increase unusual, extreme weather, is having a daily effect on weather, worldwide.
It is important that our national government exercise leadership to improve the resiliency of the entire nation in the face of continuing extreme weather.


Like the dinosaurs, we and our fellow denizens of Earth may become the amber curios of a future civilization that ponders how species once so prevalent came to such a swift demise.
Why is the State Department seemingly so convinced of the inevitability of tar sands by rail when oil traders themselves are much more cautious?

Local authorities are trying to intimidate people to cater to the interests of corporate giants, but it does not end there.

Despite its status as one of the most hazardous consumer products ever created, PVC and its associated chemical additives are managed in much the same way as food scraps and grass clippings after disposal.
This plan doesn't just slash that dangerous carbon pollution, but it recognizes the enormous economic potential in action -- potential that will mean a better future in Georgia.
Going green at school is a great way for your child to make a difference and set an example for others.  Classmates will likely be green with envy at all the cool waste-free lunch goodies.

The voices of GM proponents in academia and small-scale agriculture tend, more often than not, to be drowned out in the food fight between grassroots environmental organizations and Big Ag.
Anybody who has lived with cats or dogs knows this and knows it for certain

In 2009 two Taiwanese national-park employees arrived at my doorstep in Sarasota, Florida, determined to learn everything about the canopy walkway built in nearby Myakka River State Park. This unique treetop walkway has not only inspired research discoveries but doubled (or even tripled) visitors to the park.
American city dwellers place a high value on their cities' food offerings, from restaurants to farmers' markets.  We also love historic buildings and good public spaces.  Traffic, not so much.
Beans, I say. Beans, beans, beans -- chickpeas, black beans, flageolets, lentils, any kind of dried beans you like. Also known as legumes on this side of the Atlantic and pulses in the UK, they're a cheap vegan's go-to source for plant-based protein, fiber and a wealth of phytonutrients.



They have spent the past four years creating a body of work that is unparalleled in this area, planting seeds of sustainability as they go with their workshops and seed bank and presentations.
It is clear that the solar industry has entered a bright new phase of solar-related storage market and application development. Its versatility and adaptability is a major factor.






The story is all too familiar to those who have seen their own quaint slices of paradise transformed to huge international hotel developments, taking over prime beach areas and hurting the cultural and natural resources that drew the giants there in the first place.
NASA has laid out some pretty sci-fi sounding plans for the next 20 years of space travel, but a more critical mission -- at least for the sustainability of human life here on earth -- may be the one it launched in Mountain View, California, just over two years ago.



Last Friday, the U.S. EPA formally proposed limitations that would block the massive, ill-conceived Pebble Mine projectThis action by EPA is a critical step toward protecting Bristol Bay's salmon from the inevitable devastation that a large-scale mine would cause.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Climate Assessment warned of parched prairies and flaming forests if we don't reel in climate change right now.
Australia's household solar revolution has caught the government-owned electricity sector by surprise. More than one million Australians have already installed solar panels on their rooftops. It has caused demand for electricity from the grid to plummet.
We are ALL complicit in fossil fuel fortunes, whether we are middle class or mega wealthy. We have all benefited, enormously, from the cheap and abundant and reliable power that has come of oil and coal.
The railways need to learn from the Exxon Valdez spill and put in place preventive measures to protect the environment before we see the rail equivalent of a Valdez disaster.

Ag-gag laws violate the will of the American people, and they contradict American values as enshrined in our Constitution. Animal agriculture should be working to eliminate cruelty to animals, not the investigations that expose it.

On African cocoa farms, children are frequently forced to work from 6 a.m. until the evening. They're made to live in windowless sheds and subjected to beatings and whippings for working slowly or attempting to escape.


As the post-mortems arrive to determine the cause of death for Australia's carbon tax, a couple of questions emerge

The recently released 2014 U.S. Clean Tech Leadership Index from Clean Edge, the research and advisory firm where I am senior editor, finds the U.S. clean-tech market making impressive strides in many areas, while still hampered by inaction and inertia in others.

As a community committed to building a better tomorrow, we should consider two things
If you needed a reason for your family to become vegetarian, I suggest that you take this latest staggering ocean discovery to heart and make the switch now.

Just as we did with bald eagles, peregrine falcons, sea turtles and grizzlies, we have a legal and moral duty to protect wolverines, remarkable survivors able to sniff out carrion buried beneath several feet of snow.

Innovation, persistence, and an attitude of mutuality in the midst of intense sociological and political resistance is the key to creating more large-scale natural places that people will visit and cherish for hundreds of years into the future.

At a time when clean energy markets around the world are growing swiftly and offer opportunities for U.S. exports, the Ex-Im bank plays a critical role in project financing for renewable energy projects.




A few early-summer visits to the local farmers market are usually all it takes to turn us into cheerleaders for the American farm. But if you really want to know about the current state of farming in the U.S.A., you'll need some real, hard facts.


Policymakers in Washington today may stand divided on party lines over a whole host of issues, but management of our oceans doesn't need to be one of them.


New York's City's hugely successful and justly celebrated High Line wasn't the first elevated urban railroad bed to be converted into a much-loved linear park.

As I watch the frenzied World Cup competition approach its apex, I cannot help but wonder why human beings are more interested in kicking balls around a field than they are in the fact that our activities have bought us a one-way ticket to extermination.





What if you heard that other fishermen were unintentionally catching large numbers of vulnerable marine animals like dolphins, whales, and sea turtles -- damaging gear and hurting their own bottom lines? Waste on this scale occurs every day in many U.S. fisheries, hurting both fishermen and marine life.


After being called to help calm her boss' adult male pet chimpanzee Travis at home, Charla Nash suffered a disfiguring attack from the powerful 200-pound animal that left her barely alive.
There is an open window for smart planning that can go a long way in protecting the values of national parks from damage caused by unplanned or badly planned oil and gas development on neighboring BLM lands. But this window won't remain open long.




It's a sad circumstance when lawmakers and their allies in the trophy-hunting community try to squelch the voting rights of citizens, in their zeal to kill animals who are rare, who've harmed no one, and who have a rightful place in this great state.

The silence surrounding agroecology is profoundly disturbing. Proposals for \sustainable intensification\ or \climate smart\ GMOs can only be peddled as answers to the problems of hunger and global warming by studiously avoiding agroecological science and practice.



DeSmogBlog is publishing the first documents ever obtained from the Wisconsin government revealing routes for oil-by-rail trains in the state carrying oil obtained via hydraulic fracturing (\fracking\) in the Bakken Shale basin.










International laws are often hard to enforce, and national laws don't usually address the day to day operations of a tourism business that makes it sustainable.

Most people think that a raccoon family that has moved in is here to stay, but in fact, Mama Raccoon and babies will leave together once the babies are old enough.




The world has changed a lot since Copenhagen
From the fuzzy bumblebees that our children chase in the garden to the industrious honeybees that sweeten our herbal tea, bees have woven an essential place in nature's mosaic. But bees are now caught in the toxic web of our climate crisis.
There is an extraordinary push by certain individuals to extol the wonders of thorium-fueled nuclear reactors. In fact, so concerted is this push that some blame me for preventing the ongoing expansion of such technology. So here are the facts about thorium for those who are interested.
The maps. It was initially all about the maps. But it is geography that unites and divides.

I witnessed pomp and circumstance at prep schools from Orlando to the Napa Valley and at colleges from Los Angeles to the Ivy League. The surprising topic at all of these cap-and-gown fests? Endowments divesting their holdings in fossil fuel companies.

Why do Americans so value nature?  There are probably as many reasons as there are Americans. With the start of summer, The Trust for Public Land is furthering the national movement to promote parks and open space by collecting testimonials for nature from men, women, and children nationwide.








When you take up the cause of the so-called pit bull, you make a lot of charming friends. Particularly fetching is the person on Twitter who calls herself \Eradicate Pits.\
Today, the Earth got a little hotter, and a little more crowded.

Denial is a waste of American ingenuity, talent and energy. If we want to remain competitive in the global economy, we should redirect our energies into making America great through conservation, innovation and education.
Last year, the Icelandic government unilaterally increased its ocean-killing quota by authorizing death warrants for 770 endangered Fin, in addition to 1,145 Northern Minke whales, over the next five years.

Time around, due to the North Dakota Public Records Statute, Big Rail and Big Oil didn't get away with it.
It seems that California Governor Brown's January 2014 plea for 20 percent water conservation has done little to actually reduce consumption across the state.

A new report shows that these very same pesticides are found in many of our backyard plants -- at levels of concern -- that are meant to support pollinators.
We all have an idea of what we'd like life to be like with our dogs. Depending on our own lifestyle, we might need a dog to be social around kids, be athletic, dog-friendly, or any of a host of traits. But sometimes the dog we get is not the dog we want.
Over the years, I have witnessed the steady decline of the dolphins that used to chase our boat, the fish that I could land, and the plentiful shellfish I took for granted. The oceans of my childhood have been overfished, polluted, and strewn with plastic waste.



With the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service moving toward dropping Endangered Species Act protections for grizzly bears that live in and around Yellowstone National Park, few Americans likely realize the bears occupy a mere 4 percent of their historic range in the lower 48 states.



The first stage in planting doubt is to deny the evidence. When the evidence can no longer be denied, the second stage kicks in with its disingenuous claim
Whether it be for actions taken by the EPA or the State Department, congratulations to the Obama Administration are due for leadership on both carbon emissions and marine conservation. Let these efforts be the first of many.

Our oceans are one of our nation's most valuable natural resources. And congressional leaders should capitalize on this opportunity by adding stronger protections for essential habitat that fish populations need to spawn and grow in a healthy marine ecosystem.
In recent years, bees have been under assault from pesticides, disease, unseasonably cold winters and the research-confounding Colony Collapse Disorder. And fighting the fight that keeps bees in our ecosystem are folks such as Liydia and Vladimir.
With luck, and with the successful implementation of the EPA regulations, no poisons will enter this owl family's food chain and this little owlet will grow up strong and healthy.
Far from killing jobs, this policy would create jobs and protect lives. When House Speaker John Boehner asks, \Where are the jobs?\, advocates of market-based emissions-reduction policies can point to this study and say, \Right here!\
Poachers recently killed Satao, one of Kenya's best known elephants, whose tusks weighed more than 100 pounds each and reached all the way to the ground. A poison arrow felled Satao in Tsavo National Park, and his death was announced last Friday.
One in five people around the world, approximately 1.3 billion people, lack access to electricity.



It's time to plant a garden. If you don't have one already, this is your moment. If you have one, maybe you could help others plant their own. You might find that you are nourishing your own life by nourishing another's.

Evidence pointing to the reality of human caused environmental change is increasingly streaming through global media outlets and information sources.


The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proclaimed 2014 the International Year of Family Farming. There are 500 million smallholder farms worldwide and more than two billion people in the world depend on them for their livelihoods.
When Richard Revesz introduced Howard Shelanski at his only public appearance so far, Revesz described Shelanski as, \from our perspective, close to the most important official in the federal government.\

Within a few months, New Orleans-based Helis Oil & Gas Co. hopes to explore a deep part of the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale play by drilling down 13,000 feet near Mandeville, La. Other companies are fracking shallower parts of the TMS deposit to the northwest.


In 200 years humans have slaughtered an astounding five million whales. All remaining populations are well below three percent of the early 1800s, but the ruthless 'War Against Whales' is set to resume in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
The World Bank has not yet addressed climate issues systematically. Most notably, its Safeguard Policy framework does not require climate change risk assessments for Bank projects. This gap in policy has allowed the World Bank to continue financing projects with serious implications for our climate and to essentially ignore the issue completely.

Clean energy enjoys strong, broad, bipartisan support. It's time to make more citizens aware of what their elected representatives are actually doing -- or not doing -- to support it.

The proposal offers an opportunity for Iowa to continue to grow its booming wind sector and implement solar and energy efficiency to a greater extent, creating a more affordable, more independent, and cleaner electric system. In fact, Iowa is already on a path to meet the emissions reduction target set by EPA.

Here's the truth
You've read the headlines. Whether it's the exponential melt of glaciers, declining crop yields, loss of biodiversity, super-storms powered by warming oceans, or the increasing vulnerability of drinking water supplies to contamination, we are living well beyond our means.
Now, halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, we've hit the wall. California is in a drought -- some call it the third year of a drought, but it could also be called the 10th dry year out of the last 13. Even if next year brings some relief, our water problems will remain.
Apparently standing opposite the vegan paradise I had reached is a horrible enemy -- genetically modified food.

The sunscreens on our list are chemical-free, protect against both UVA (skin cancer-causing) and UVB (sunburn) rays and are all under $25.

Insurance companies are saying they simply won't pay for the stubbornness of city planners who don't factor in the damaging effects of climate change. In fact, they're suing these towns and cities for failure to prepare for climate change.
Beneath the hyperbolic rhetoric and pushback last week surrounding the new EPA regulations to limit carbon emissions is a fundamental truth that can no longer be ignored




This week's announcement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants by almost one-third is a great step in the right direction. But global warming is not only caused by carbon dioxide. Climate change is a multifaceted problem that requires a multifaceted set of solutions.

Two activist groups want the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to recall Monsanto's Roundup, the most widely used herbicide/pesticide in the world. Now is the time to do it, they say, because the EPA is conducting a registration review of glyphosate, the key ingredient in Roundup.
I was honored to be invited to speak to the United Auto Workers in Detroit at their convention this week. Even though the Sierra Club and the UAW have been working together for years, some people don't know we're natural allies.

Battery cages are the cruelest of all factory farming systems, are illegal across the European Union. California should be celebrated, not sued, for taking a stand against these inhumane practices.




There is a long history of claims that new rules to protect the environment or human health will seriously harm the United States economy. These claims are political fodder, they are provocative, and they are always wrong.

Yes, it's sad that we lost Peggy and Hershey, but their survivals were success stories. Peggy was given the chance to increase the genetic diversity of her species through the Species Survival Plan (SSP). Hershey was able to spend her final years running free as a wild cheetah thanks to CCF's rewilding program.

The assault on nature is mostly from multi-national companies that regularly bribe government officials. Irreparable damage has occurred to priceless rainforests and millions of people are suffering.


Night Moves definitely works as a tense, lo-fi psychological thriller. But the environmental dimension is what gives Night Moves its interesting moral dimension, as well as informing the unique world where the film takes place.
Perhaps trust is just too romantic of an ideal in a complicated food system. I'd argue the opposite


It's hard to make the decision to rehome a dog who hasn't done anything wrong, especially when there is a strong emotional attachment. Unfortunately, part of being a responsible owner is having to make the tough decisions that are for our dogs' own good, even if it causes us pain.

It's not just that a certain place consistently produces food that tastes the same.

We can fence national boundaries with concrete and barbed wire, but unseen CO2 emissions are released into a border-less atmosphere. Right now, we are on track to triple these emissions by century's end.
Basically, it's time to change our entire eating and drinking paradigm.

Is the food industry to blame for the increasing epidemic of obesity in our society today?
In addition to the positive steps of developing the new field of sustainability management, we will also need to implement an effective set of rules governing our interaction with our home planet's environment.


Those politicians who love to quote Mandela, King and Gandhi, should not forget the responsibility of doing the imagined better, that comes with their message of love for all humans and whole humankind.  And me and you have a responsibility in that too. We're all the next generation.






Ironically, this is the first time I've toured this particular auto-assembly plant (which was first owned by General Motors; then by NUMMI, a joint venture between GM and Toyota; and now by Tesla), even though much of my understanding of innovation and sustainability comes from bird-dogging the evolution of this building over the years.
A few days after the cargo ship Galapaface I ran aground on the rocks off San Crist\u00f3bal Island, Gal\u00e1pagos, high tides strengthened by a full moon rotated the ship some 40 degrees, further damaging its hull and worrying the people involved in the salvage effort.
Our deltas are literally sinking, shrinking and in grave a peril, and some may not survive in the coming years. This will impact millions of people, major food producing regions as well as valuable ecosystems.


For a relatively small cost, the new Indian government could take a huge leap forward in addressing energy poverty. That leap could provide a path forward to a radical change in India's energy future from carbon-heavy to carbon-light energy production.

The Koch brothers, who have built up their vast fortune through oil, gas and coal, will battle to protect their fossil fuel interests. If they succeed, it would mark doom for Barack Obama's second-term green agenda.
The health of all bees is of paramount importance for our survival on Earth. Frighteningly, bees worldwide are terribly ill.
There is no time to delay.  Earlier this month, our nation's leading climate scientists confirmed that climate change is real, is caused by humans, and is already harming communities across America.  They concluded that the scientific evidence is \unequivocal.\

For a fraction of the dollars moving through the virtual-tech world, the Bay Area's working landscapes could be permanently protected. And the clean air, water and foodsheds that we all rely upon could be safeguarded.
So far, we haven't had the will, and the sense of responsibility, to do what's often inconvenient in order to change the climate trajectory. Too many attempt to stay comfy in individual cocoons, avoiding action and seemingly unconcerned even about their own children, let alone their neighbors on this planet.


Those who understand the urgent need to address climate change are the optimists who see climate solutions as beneficial for our health and economic prosperity, while those who deny the problem or think there's nothing we can do about it are the pessimists. Nobody likes a pessimist.
We need to mobilize, on a war-like footing to save the planet and learn to produce enough goods and services to ensure environmentally sustainable economic growth.




Recently, a somewhat obscure scientific journal rejected a paper. Somehow, that made the front page of the London Times and spawned a number of articles in the right-wing press. How in the world does a rejected manuscript warrant front-page media coverage? Here's how.
With nowhere to go and no way to pass the hours at SeaWorld, captive orcas often gnaw on the concrete and iron-bar tank separators, sometimes breaking their teeth and leaving the pulp exposed and painfully raw.
Thirty years ago I led a campaign to save Antarctica. It was one of the best things I've ever done. It was enough for me to know that it was there, with its pristine beauty, incredible wildlife, and vast open expanses. I didn't need to see it to want to save it.




Last week's news seemed to show the market moving towards an acceptance of climate change's negative impact on corporate earnings -- and a rejection of fossil fuel investments on purely financial terms.
What if there was a way to reduce the risk of many major diseases at the same time as helping improve your overall health, decreasing your weight and boosting your energy?
Regulating or taxing carbon emissions is no longer a partisan or ideological issue -- it's a matter of business and investment, and of vital importance.

According to some estimates, as much as 40 percent of fish caught around the globe is discarded at sea, dead or dying. We can't afford to continue this wasteful practice.
When a shopper spends their hard-earned money on meat that is labeled \humanely raised\ or \sustainably farmed,\ it's not unreasonable for them to assume that someone has validated the truthfulness of the claim. In fact, USDA is supposed to be doing it.
I ask, though, how \free\ are we now as mining, oil and lumber companies lobby to exploit the land, and as legislators grant corporations enormous tax breaks and subsidies?

What does the future look like? Will emissions keep climbing? How can a country like Turkey keep increasing the wealth of its citizens, yet also cut greenhouse gases?





Climate impacts are happening now, whether it's constant extreme weather alerts, droughts and wildfires in the West, or the melting Arctic leading to an extremely snowy winter in the South. But climate denialism continues to grip leaders in Congress.
Mothers care about their children more than anything on earth, and we will do anything to ensure their well-being. But the escalating climate crisis threatens our children's current and future well-being, and it must be stopped.
Since our energy demands are ever increasing, it is unlikely that current alternative energy sources are going to take over as a majority, and that is the problem. That is the energy crisis.
Boxer is the mother of two children and the grandmother of four. I reached out to her for a Moms Clean Air Force Mother's Day exclusive interview.
Frackers drill down many thousands of feet and then work horizontally. They inject water, sand or ceramic beads, and chemicals to create subsurface fissures. Oil and gas are extracted from those fissures. The water used rises back to the surface over time.



How unusual has the weather been? No one event is \caused\ by climate change, but global warming, which is predicted to increase unusual, extreme weather, is having a daily effect on weather, worldwide.


Context is everything

I recently returned from a place that comes just short of this ultimate alchemy -- Israel, a small strip of desert with no water or oil. Not an ideal place to build an agricultural oasis. But that is exactly what the Israeli water conservationists have accomplished.





New born chicks give the cat in a hat a run for his money.
Following its rediscovery the iguana became a flagship for conservation in the West Indies, and the focus of an international recovery program.
Our eating habits profoundly affect our individual health and well-being; our social, economic, and political systems; and our environment. Our future success as a species may hinge on our food habits.
The planet is warming; the question is how much we will be able to mitigate the consequences of this fact. Fighting to keep fossil fuels undrilled and working for large landscape conservation seem like good places to start.

Platform A is the site of infamous 1969 oil spill in Santa Barbara. Now, over 50 years later, when offered the opportunity to return to Santa Barbara to explore platforms A and C, Amber Jackson and I dove at the chance!
For the first time ever, eight governors and two Canadian premiers -- separated by borders but connected by the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin -- signed a Mutual Aid Agreement to work together to fight aquatic invasive species such as Asian carp.
We are learning of the unbelievable distances birds travel.
In January, an inspector from the U.S. Department of Agriculture found a four-week-old shih tzu puppy lying dead -- frozen solid -- in the outdoor portion of an enclosure of a puppy mill in Stover, Missouri -- the state with the notorious distinction of being the hub of the puppy mill industry.








So now what? If we have truly found ourselves at the point in human history when we cannot avert environmental catastrophe, what should we be doing?




Often, planners, landscape architects, engineers, architects and other built environment professionals adopt ecological principles into their designs of regions, cities and individual developments. But do these designs function as originally intended?

Are we really still having these conversations? Surely it is time for all nations to commit to concerted action to combat climate change -- our world depends on it.
Whatever your choice, make sure you are keeping the inside of your home as healthy and natural as the outside.
I've traveled to northern Ethiopia to work with locals on forest sustainability. As a conservation biologist, I'm one of Mother Nature's sleuths, trying to find, identify, and determine the health of this country's declining native trees -- before they completely disappear.
The move follows a series of internationally reported environmental horror stories from China over the past year, including epic levels of urban air pollution and tens of thousands of pig carcasses decaying in the local water supply.




Virunga National Park is a unique asset that could, if utilized correctly, be an economic development engine. We believe it is important for the Congolese to chart a development path that benefits the majority, not a privileged few, and above all else, enforce its own laws.
Several of the CLAs present with me in Berlin commented that given the nature and outcome of the week, the resulting document should probably be called the 'summary by policymakers,' rather than the 'summary for policymakers.'


The five steps (freeze agriculture's footprint, grow more on existing farms, use resources more efficiently, shift diets, reduce waste) are all good technological fixes, none of which are terribly complicated. So if they are so great, why aren't we implementing them?

Renewables are now a lot cheaper and better than they were when the last IPCC report came out seven years ago. It's time to put them to use.
Chevron continued its unprecedented campaign of attacking its critics last week when I was forcibly removed from a conference simply because I was affiliated with Amazon Watch. The excuse given for the outrageous step was that it was a preemptive act to prevent something they feared I might do.

I worked for the U.S. EPA from 1979 to 2004, spending most of my time with the program dealing with pesticides. It did not take me long to figure out that the EPA was reeling from the scandal of the Industrial Bio-test Laboratory, IBT.




Do you think any human can adequately inspect three birds every second to ensure they are free of feathers, feces, lesions, bile and other contaminants?
Earth Day 2014 provides an opportunity to look at what nuclear science and technology has done to establish sustainable development by improving health and the quality of life.


Rigs to Reefs, in which an oil company chooses to modify a platform so that it can continue to support marine life as an artificial reef, is rapidly becoming an issue of public concern, scientific study and policy debate.
