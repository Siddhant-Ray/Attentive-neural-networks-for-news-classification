We're not aiming for the new, hot ones (though some are on here) -- just strictly the best places to get delicious cocktails.
Food photos just graduated to video, and we're not excited.
I like to tip. I really do. I go out of my way to leave big ones for baristas, bartenders, and waiters who've earned something extra. I just don't understand why I have to. If \gratuity\ is required, is it really gratuity?
This idea was inspired by the Italian Easter tradition of wrapping chocolate eggs in colorful paper with a surprise inside.
Kimchi can be intimidating for the uninitiated, but for Koreans it's the ultimate staple. To get the scoop on understanding kimchi we had Joo walk us through all the steps of how it is made, what types of vegetables are used for kimchi and what to pair it with.
Grilled Thai chicken with coconut peanut sauce is a crowd pleaser for all ages. It's the sauce that makes it so good. In fact, you will be tempted to forget the chicken entirely and just have the sauce as soup!


Grits, much like porridge, are the ultimate comfort food. Most Southerners love grits, and I am no exception.
Dust off your blender and get to work.
Put it in the oven for a few minutes and you've got the kind of baked pasta that everyone adores.
Why do coffee stains always form a ring?
We're witnessing the pinnacle of food hype, right here.
I've become a fan of recreating our favorite dishes with ingredients everyone will love.

It's almost Frappuccino time again -- the weather starts warming and in comes the slew of flavored, iced coffee concoctions drizzled with syrup. All across the world, Starbucks outlets are getting creative with what they put in this delicious frozen coffee drink.
Would you spend $12,040 on a drink?


We're here to shed a little light on that Tiki-themed hero that is Trader Joe.
From biltong strips at a South African braii, to galbi at All-You-Can-Eat Korean Barbecue.

At this point of the year, we're generally dreaming about margaritas and G&Ts (and mint juleps, of course, during the Kentucky Derby). But it seems that brown spirits are going to continue to have their year.
Here are a few bites from each of our country's great stadiums.


Happy Cinco de Mayo!
Cinco de Mayo is more than an excuse to drink margaritas.
Believe it or not, brining is a hotly debated topic. (Does the barbecue world ever agree on anything?) Some people swear by it, while others scoff at the effort and time it can take (as little as 15 minutes or as long as several weeks).
Making salad dressings at home is easy, and nothing compares to the taste of fresh herbs mixed with good olive oil and bright citrus. Light vinaigrettes are easy to make with just a few ingredients on hand.
Not only is it a celebration of the leisurely weekend afternoon, it's a time to get together with friends, shake off the events of the night before and consume far more calories (in both food and alcohol form) than should be socially acceptable.

FINALLY.
Watch the charming trailer for this film, and then promptly go get a bagel with lox and cream cheese.
Say good-bye to soggy, fall-apart black bean burgers.

We never need much of a reason for a fiesta.
This isn't clever plating; it happens automatically when some of the sauce slides over the rice. Looks great, doesn't it?
There's more to life than tequila and bourbon, even on Cinco de Derby weekend. And on May 6, when you're margarita'd and mint julep'd out and are looking for a change of pace, you'll thank me.

Your name might not be Jamie Oliver, but it takes a lot less than you think to become a master chef in your own kitchen.
It was the best of corn, it was the cheapest of corn.
What makes a great Italian restaurant anyway? For some it may be the antipasti. For others some combination of how good the wines and pastas are. Holding up one dish is dangerous. Octopus? Lasagna? Cacio e pepe?
Every spoonful is packed with the flavors of salty pecan, honey apple and sugary sweet whipped cream.
What strange toppings would you put on your pizza? Prawns? Crocodile? Kangaroo?

Here's a pretty much season-neutral sauce that I've served with fish and with slow-roasted vegetables.
This is serious, people.
Personally, I don't even like going a day without dessert, let alone a year. Enter Healthy Peanut Butter Cookies.
Drinking beer at home may never be the same.
Put time into dinner now, and you can make it last forever -- or at least the whole week.

Of course, not all macaroni and cheese is made alike.
There are plenty of foods that have no business being in a can.

Do you love 'em or hate 'em?
If Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville is your happy place, this stuff's for you.

I collected this recipe from scraps found in my grandma's old notebook, which had been buried in a closet for several years.
I often hear people describe cooking for one as depressing, and, while I usually nod sympathetically, I have almost never found that to be the case.
