A new law would make it illegal for Indianans to be Knob Heads in any way, shape or form. And it would also give individuals and businesses the right to refuse to serve anyone acting or indeed sounding like a total Knob Head.



Couldn't the editors have been mindful of the fact that comparing Jews and dogs, in any context, might be considered -- oh, just maybe -- insulting?









At my local library, in the parking lot, by two of the spots near the door, there are signs that read, \Hybrid Low-Emission Parking Only.\ Excuse me while I go puke, would you?

Deep space. The Nostromo. Ripley encounters the Alien in her private quarters:
To further this exploration of human emotion, I am going to follow up with Hashtag Angry Elephants, the story of a girl and her discussion of anger.  It will have nothing to do with Twitter and even less to do with angry elephants.

Floridians, I've had just about enough of the \sucks to be you\ jokes and memes plastered all over Facebook. I get that it's warm where you are and that there are luscious beaches in all directions.

The only thing better than a cute baby is their own reaction to their irresistible cuteness!









This macabre fixation with mounting and ornamenting animal cadavers seems shocking, morbid and downright disturbing. To understand Walter Potter's hobby, we need to examine it against the backdrop of his lifestyle in the mid-1800s.


As the lines of politics and entertainment become even more blurred, one can only wonder what the 2016 crop of presidential hopefuls will resort to as they campaign for the nation's highest office.
Dear Starbucks Barista

All I have to show for my hard work is an unfinished script and a butt rash screaming for A&D ointment. Curses on HBO Access. Sharts to all involved in this evil scheme to build me up and flush my dreams down the toilet.
Offended people can choose to avert their attention to the drunken uncle or the pouting teenager, or the Rod Stewart impersonator in the band. The public nursing only lasts a few minutes and the alternative is to hear a screaming baby and witness a swollen mother in pain.




On our previous date, when discussing downtown, I explained that as much as I love certain aspects of that part of the city, I find it confusing to navigate. So the first thing he asks me to do on this date...is navigate. That better be some extra dry humor.

Monday's Wanda Sykes performance demonstrated an even wider contextual embrace, attracting a diverse, supportive and downright exuberant audience to the 2400-capacity DeVos Performance Hall.






Stolen Moment of the Week is a series featuring the work of photographer Mindy Tucker, who has been documenting the comedy scene in New York for the last seven years.

Frankly, the sun has had it too good for too long -- thanks in large part to corrupt scientists and beachgoers and plants, all pushing their radical pro-sun agenda. But that doesn't change the facts at hand.
Train people, rejoice. I've realized I'm far too cynical and set in my ways to join your ranks. I'm returning to my eye surgeon in a few days, eagerly anticipating hearing those four magical words

Inside sources report Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis resorted to hostile threats last month as bailout negotiations with the country's creditors faltered.

Herbert \Doc\ Koenig is a security guard in the building where I work. He don't need no stinking badge (he has an ID card with a photo of his goateed visage and the word \Doc\ under it) and he doesn't carry a pistol, mainly because he is one. But he does have a rapier wit that could disarm the most suspicious intruder.

I realize it's improper to ask, but may I inquire, dear reader, as to how old you are? I only pry because I want to let you know -- for your own good! -- if you are dateable or not.
Years ago, I had my wisdom teeth removed. And under some mild anesthesia and ample Vicoden, it was a rather pleasant experience. But Dr. Mengele wanted to extract the tooth right then and there, using nothing more than Novocaine and some semi-rusty pliers.

While I imagine this question is intended as a pleasant conversation starter, what people don't realize is that the answer for many of us is complicated, fraught with pain or shame, and not as innocuous as commenting on say, the state of the weather, or the state of the Union.


This lawsuit and most of the rhetoric of those that oppose Obamacare is a blatant disrespect for lower-income Americans. Who are these Americans? They are families, college students in deep debt, people with serious health issues, senior citizens, first-generation Americans, single mothers, YOU.


E.L. James writes badly enough to teach young writers a lot.  Her novel is filled with negative lessons, especially when it comes to her prose.  And it's just hilarious. Here are five of my favorite funny bad lines.





Chanukah had started, the menorah was lit\nThe family had sung, now they'd give gifts and sit

Watch the first episode of The Final Edition's new Jihadistan-based sitcom, \Secret Diaries of a Terrorist.\
I'm from Buffalo by way of Canada. I know Winter. She and I have battled for years and I want to tell you how to deal with her - concede defeat! Just deal!
The biggest problem is not who receives the death penalty. It's who doesn't receive it. In a fair and just society, we're going to have to start executing a hell of a lot more people.

Things happen all the time that we can't control. People let us down. Things don't turn out the way we want them to. And, sometimes -- almost always -- all you can do is laugh, and feel better than you did before. Thank you Harris Wittels, not only for laughing, but for not being scared to. I hope it's okay if we laugh too.
Silver threads and golden needles...


Going to the bathroom is a guaranteed way to get someone on the line. The second I'm indisposed, the representative is sure to pick up, and at last, from rooms away, I hear a person.
The voters that make up the Republican base don't just want chili-cheese fries... they want to feast on the ground, raw, red meat of anyone who disagrees with them, while claiming that America is a Christian nation. That's the kind of diet we should make fun of.









So as a Valentine's Day present, here are three fun examples of how Facebook is adding to the already impossible to solve problem of Love...



This awards season, forget American Sniper. See the controversial movie Quebec separatists don't want you to see but conservationists can't wait for you to see but botanists forbid you to see but environmentalists say you must see. See Canadian Sniper--or at least its trailer. Go Canucks!






I'm intent on keeping my marriage intact, so this Valentine's Day I'll consider how this saving money thing may be something best enjoyed together, rather than alone. So when he leans in this Valentine's weekend and whispers in my ear \Let's talk about the budget,\ I'll be ready.
Obama promised us the utopias of Philip K. Dick and Aldous Huxley and all we got was James Cameron

Have you ever heard of a famous everyday phrase, but never knew what it really means or where it came from? Well, now you can be the smartest student in class -- grab your notebook and a seat, it's time to learn some awesome trivia on \Famous Phrases!\

Dogs get the value of cuddling for its own sake. They like to snuggle up to you while you read in bed and while you polish your toenails and while you talk on the phone, and this is actually -- get this -- all they want. What's more, dogs are actually interested in whatever you are interested in. Jazz concerts by the lake? Awesome.
Technically, I'm in love with Netflix and I'm going public about it. Dad if you're reading this I'm sorry I didn't turn out to be the heterosexual man you wanted. All I want is to live freely as a technosexual. I'm happy and proud.






Governor Chris Christie today announced that his choice for Surgeon General would be \my Auntie Ida, who always said that the best way to cure a wound is just let it dry out in the fresh air, even if the air is in Newark.\
In an effort to search for love, I listen to all sorts of stories. Good ones, bad ones, hilarious ones, scary ones... there's no shortage of stories out there.
It was the photo entitled \Puppy in a Onesie\ that put me over the edge. Before that it'd been something of a slow burn. I knew on some conscious level that my sense of irritation was increasing but the gravity of the subject was so minor that I ignored the agitation.
I realize that I could be deported for saying this but I can't hold back any more.  I hate sports.  I find sports so boring that I once brought a stack of magazines with me to the World Series.
I once told my mother-in-law...



Dear Husband, I hope you enjoy your lunch. I made that pizza just for you. Pick a slice, any slice. I call this game Russian Rewards Roulette.


My data analytics consultant informs me that I am not trending, especially among millennials.  She suggests I publish lists since millennials click on lists.  Being data-driven, I am test-blogging potential lists.
This time of year, it's easy to hole up, reassess everything a little TOO much, and generally be a drag to everyone -- even your kids' hamsters. I mean really, when you are snuggling a hamster and telling it how well it understands you, it's time to do a little check-in.

In a stunning news development, a Trumbull County, Ohio resident has been discovered who claims to have no opinion whatsoever about the Clint Eastwood-directed film American Sniper.





f you are reading this and you live in LA, and you are not here pursuing one of the above mentioned dreams, (acting, singing, dancing, writing, porn etc.) then please, leave as soon as humanly possible. Just pack up all your stuff, load it into your twelve year old minivan and move to Las Vegas, or Houston or Denver or San Diego or wherever the hell I'm not. Really, you'll be glad you did.


If there is one kind of doctor I could never be, it's a gastroenterologist. Aside from the fact that I'm a gasbag, the reason is simple













Every other sheriff in America has rugs reading \In God We Trust,\ and people evidently care so little about that statement that they'll walk on it for months before noticing it's misprinted. But if you tell folks to trust in dog, then you're doing something noteworthy.
According to a Blacademy spokesperson, \It's not that white actors weren't good enough ... It's just that there were a lot of great performances by black actors this year.  In fact, some very good black actors weren't even nominated. That's how you know it's not a race issue.\


In an odd and somewhat twisted way, this experience has been good for me. It's taught me a little bit about letting go and a hell of a lot about patience. I know I can't rush things along. I realize that I am no longer on my schedule, but on the schedule of two little furry monsters that I love so much.


Have you seen my glasses?






In perfect holiday fashion, we're gift giving a little early for all of you millennials. Generation Y is not only our now but our future so we're shedding some light on what you should be drinking.

Truth be told, it's amazing how just by not doing the simplest of things you can get an instant leg up on most of your fellow applicants.






She doesn't quite fit.




The movie insults anyone who has ever written a script that couldn't get made. OK, I'm bitter. Anyone who shares Guild membership in Writer's and Director's Guilds, can we take away people's membership? Take those cards, please!
Here at the Center for Keepin' It Real, we have developed the \Low Expectations and Standards System,\ (LESS) and its message is -- surprisingly enough -- keep your expectations and standards low, low, low.

While the prospect of patching up the road ahead may be bumpy, especially when you trudge through the potholes of 2014, some past wisdom may help us along the way.

In the hopes of achieving success and getting things on the right track, let's all agree to say goodbye to the following 10 things. Like American Idol, Grey's Anatomy and Glee, they had their time in the sun, but let's face it, it's over.
Rush Limbaugh thinks the next James Bond should be played by a white actor. It's not fair. White people get all the good roles -- like the actor who currently plays the comical Rush Limbaugh character.

Despite my neighbors still having their wreath on the door and a creepy stand-up Santa Claus in the hallway, the holidays are over. So this must mean that we're yet again closing in on another stellar year of life. And what a year it was!


Stolen Moment of the Week is a series featuring the work of photographer Mindy Tucker, who has been documenting the comedy scene in New York for the last seven years.
I can already see myself getting sucked into some pointless game for days on end. If you don't hear from me for, oh, the next 16 months or so, please come steal my son's Xbox and save me.




Don't fool yourself into thinking this is something that could last. Are you prepared to become the stepmother to nine reindeer and a whole toy factory's worth of elves? Do you really want to leave everything behind to move to the North Pole?



Out on the sidewalk, I have absolutely no clue how this date is going -- and I'm usually pretty adept at gauging the waters. He suggests another (quieter) bar down the street. I take that as a positive.
It's practically 2015, and we mustn't forget the Tiffany Pollards and Brooklyns of the world. It was the perfectly highlighted and coiffed Todd Chrisley who said, \You don't ever go out of the house with your snapdragon snappin.'\ I will buy a round of beer for anyone who can translate that.
Besides being recklessly and unnecessarily provocative (Kim Jong-un isn't widely known for his generous sense of humor), it stuck me not only as a lazy and unequivocal cheap shot, but as a schoolyard bully move.

Oh, Santa. Baby. How long will our merry go round keep going round? Do  we need couples counseling again this year? You and I have been in our indescribably on-again-off-again relationship for too long. I've been writing about our tortured love for how many years?


Answer this question truthfully for me
When asked by concerned neighbors if someone had stolen the baby Jesus, Newirth made it clear that the absence of baby Jesus was a personal choice.

My fiancee's parents won tickets to The Nutcracker, a ballet by Tchaikovsky that is considered \family friendly\ and has allegedly something to do with Christmas. Below are the notes I took regarding the general plot of the show.

The most horrifying part of the Senate's CIA Torture Report is the general public reaction, which is not a unanimous \this is horrendous.\
It's quite a challenge for a comic to stand before a cancer foundation and entertainment executive crowd and make 'em laugh.
You don't have to have kids to get a pet. Some couples have been known to adopt a dog or cat as a practice family. Would Biff and Brenda make responsible parents? If they strap Ruffy to the roof of their Range Rover, probably not.
Here's why the surprise puppy needs to make a Christmas gift comeback...




There are many factors to consider when choosing a potential career; pay, prospects the elusive work/life balance. However too few people consider whether their chosen profession would in fact help them survive a zombie apocalypse.
Not long ago, I had a rather unfortunate audition for a major brand of chewing gum.  I was being seen for the part of a falafel and, as I came to learn later, also a burrito.  Confused?  Yeah, I was too, but I figured I was okay because I was a half-hour early, a precaution I take in anticipation of just this sort of thing.
As I had suspected all along, but couldn't quite figure out who or how, it took a woman (albeit an Asian women who I had a slight language barrier with) to help me figure out my problems with women.

My mother needed her Christmas card list updated because -- well there's no gentle way to put it -- her friends keep dying. Since I printed her address labels the year after my dad died, the maintenance of her Christmas card list is a job that now belongs to me.

Fox News has already launched its first counter-offensive on the \War on Christmas.\ Some people mock Bill O'Reilly and his cohorts for their annual misguided persecution complex. Not me. I look forward to their yearly ranting. It's my Shark Week.






So to all the moms and dads out there, I'm wishing you much patience as you endure whatever potentially vexing holiday traditions your children are subjecting you to around the clock this season, and of course, this final holiday wish
Hey guys, Will Durst here with your eagerly awaited Top Ten Comedic News Stories of 2014. Now, here's the deal
Every year when the holidays roll around, I brace for the inevitable wave of emotions the season brings -- emotions that I know are supposed to resemble peace and joy, but instead feel suspiciously like irritation and resentment.




Rocky LeFebre, a professional henchman who has worked for several leading super-villains, talks with Mark Osler about his fascinating and often troubling career.



This year's guide
Snarling Rottweiler T-Shirt
The buffeter get-out-of-my-wayer
Photos released by the St. Louis County Prosecutor's Office of Officer Darren Wilson, taken shortly after his altercation with 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9, 2014, appear to prove that Brown hit Officer Wilson so hard in the face that a mark was almost left on Wilson's skin.
It all started when my children coaxed me to download the App, \Words With Friends\ on my cellphone. What a neighborly sounding game it was! A few clicks and voil\u00e0! -- suddenly it was just as I remembered from my own childhood -- except you could take all day long to formulate one word and nobody minded.
You probably know a few Christmas Nazis or Thanksgiving Purists.  They may be your friends or family.  You might even be such a person. Hell, you could even fit into both groups.
When I was a child, I hated Santa Claus. Yes, you read that sentence correctly. I hated the whole idea of Santa. Who was this creepy guy who snuck into my house at night while I was sleeping? If he could get in, who else could get in?
Daddy was a very mild-mannered gentleman... he was never the type to yell, shout, etc. His style was reasoning. Except once.
Here's how to determine if you're susceptible to becoming a Compulsive Reader of Angry Posts.


The turkey was juicy. The wine did flow. How I'll burn off all these calories, I'll never know.




Yesterday my doctor confirmed my longstanding suspicion. As it turns out, I really do have my head up my ass. The news, just in time for Thanksgiving, came as no real surprise. That's because my doctor was far from the first person to tell me I have my head up my ass.





It might seem radical to have a Constitutional Convention over something like Super PACs, the unenforceable slush funds that have flourished as the latest billionaire accessory. But you know what is even crazier? Passing a Constitutional Amendment BANNING ALCOHOL.





Why Do Kids Abuse Toys?


I'm about to turn 59, which means I'll be starting my 60th voyage around the sun, a mind-blowing truth for a person who's still a child between the ears.


What's the difference between your average Joe and Joseph K, the anti-hero of Kafka's famous The Trial. Not much it turns out and that plainly was Kafka's point.
Expect saliva. Perhaps it's been awhile since you last laid your mouth upon someone's and went to bootytown. If so, welcome back. You might be surprised at how much fluid actually gets exchanged during your stay.
Because I've been around the block many times in all kinds of weather, I'm here to give unsolicited but helpful advice if you intend to enter into a new relationship. Here are some reasons you should never start dating during cold weather.

Before we know it, the bird will be going in the oven and we'll be announcing what we're thankful for with our closest friends and family. In an effort to get in the spirit, here are 6 dogs that are more ready for Thanksgiving than I am.


\Lev\ isn't a common name in Michigan so I'm used to people not hearing it correctly and asking if it's \Les.\ Over the phone they might think I said \Len\ or even \Lez.\ Seriously.



After years of incompetence and racial profiling among its forces and in light of the popular new podcast, \Serial,\ Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel has launched an innovative new program replacing the core of Chicago's police force entirely with NPR hosts and producers.
I'm very worried about being a New York Jets fan.  I'm not talking about the usual nonsense of what it is to be a Jets fan but, the usual nonsense of being a complete pessimist the day after the draft.
It is a brutal war. One that pits brother against brother, elf against gnome, reindeer against reindeer, and worst of all, Santa Claus vs. the Martians.


Because cold causes cuddles.




It sure was discouraging to see those election returns coming in and realizing that the Republicans have gained such major ground. I mean, the first thing I thought was that government regulations would start to go out the window, paving the way for a disastrous oh my God I am having so much fun with this new iPhone 6.

Fight the power by trying one of those messy, undone, \I woke up like this\ looks that are so hot right now and share your just-okay-looking face with the world!





John Oliver was right to challenge this seclusion from the public eye on his recent episode of Last Week Tonight when he had no choice but to dramatize courtroom proceedings with a bench of jurist dogs.  Clearly a better means of public information is necessary for the highest court in the land.

CATHY! OMG! I am SO sorry for the late reply! I feel horrible that it took me a week and a half to reply to your email! Wait - was that two weeks? What, three?  Super sad panda sorry! (Ha ha I saw that on Facebook today). Time goes by so fast!
Hello, my name is Dr. Francis Collins, and I am the director of the National Institutes of Health. Thank you for joining us for this live-blogging session. I am here to answer all your questions about Ebola or any other health issue. Let's get started.





You may remember Rosa G (aka comedian Karla Solarte) from her viral \Fourth of July\ and \Labor Day\ music videos. She's back with another essential holiday tune.
Halloween means many things to different people. Some consider it a night to slut it up. Others like to ham it up. But back in the day my ever-fun-loving 73-year-old aunt had her own way of observing this classic spook fest.


To the harassers I say
Breaking up has always been hard to do and having a broken heart somehow unites generations; it's a timeless pain. What's changed the game, however, is the wrench throw of social media in the aftermath of a breakup.
I don't like to dress for Halloween, but I do love dressing my Chihuahua, Jerry. Clearly, I'm not alone. The National Retail Federation estimates we humans spend $350 million on Halloween pet costumes. You're welcome.







Educators, parents, and condom manufacturers have worked to make safe sex appealing to young people for decades with minimal success - until now. Shadowing Coke's marketing tactic, Poke's \#ShareaCondom\ campaign is enjoying similar success while also preventing unplanned pregnancy and STDs.

With all due respect, this positive progress report on Women in Comedy is a tribute to Joan Rivers. She persevered to pave the path for generations of funny women. Rivers auditioned seven times over three years, before making her Tonight Show debut in 1965.
So there I was 16 -- going on 17 -- looking for someone to take care of me, when all of a sudden I met Rolph.
Now, I consider myself a nice person, but when pushed to the wall, I will come out swinging. I was starting to feel picked on, and it was annoying me. Not to mention that my decision not to have kids was a very personal one.


Do you ever find yourself thinking \I wonder what those Broken Lizard guys with the funny movies like Super Troopers and Beerfest are doing?\ Ponder no longer.


Global Odyssey Worldwide Travel Flight 416 from West Africa to New York was forced to divert to Italy when passenger William Lockhold objected to the Ebola virus in front of him reclining in its seat.

The leaves are turning color, there's a crispness in the air and pumpkins are starting to appear on lawns. This can only mean one thing









The rumored excuse for his disappearance is a bad ankle, but I believe that as much as I believe that Kim Kardashian was ever a virgin. In reality, this guy has been lost for a long long time.



Working in interior design for years, I have been presented with some unusual challenges. I am approached by a woman who is slightly less than five feet tall and weighs so little that she gets blown over when the A/C kicks on.

Apparently the love guru himself hates us and the country of France isn't doing that well either. Shockingly though, BROOKLYN has some haters... way to alienate your target audience.
This blessed miracle product promises to banish the miseries and embarrassments of long plane rides belted in beside strangers, or for that matter, a first date to go see Les Miz, after she talked you into trying the bean salad.





September is a grand month for traditions. Hopefully they did find some time to relax, because in even numbered years, the post Labor Day period marks the bare knuckles return of the American political process playoffs; with elections less than two months away, looming like a gorilla on steroids in the pantry.



No, Channing Tatum has never broken into The White House. At least not to my knowledge. Well, okay, he may have, I really don't know. The investigation is still ongoing, so I'll say that he could have, but probably didn't.








When I was a freshman in college, I self-diagnosed some uncomfortable itching in my nether region as a yeast infection, and marched myself to the nearest pharmacy to fix my ailing va-jay-jay.




Like all great games, works of genius, love affairs, and near death experiences, there is a defining moment, in Scrabble, that reigns supreme -- one existential, moon howling, Job-in-the-belly-of-the-whale moment that, metaphorically speaking, I imagine was at least partially responsible for Van Gogh cutting off his ear.
The absence of music makes the show move superfast, at a pace \regular\ podcasts would be hard-pressed to match. What Fernando and Greg may lack in podcast quirkiness is more than made up for with caffeinated, high energy, radio hijinks.

After announcing my liberation from Facebook, I'd get all kinds of kudos and fan mail from people who told me I was a hero, a revolutionary, fighting the Orwellian shackles that Zuckerberg had chained us with.




Here's a basic truism

I'm not saying it's OK to poison cats -- it's not; it's animal cruelty -- and I'm not saying I want to poison my cat. I'm just saying I would find it very selfless of him if he were to volunteer for the experiment.








So, apparently, the messenger app is bad -- really bad, in fact. But perhaps because we're all used to living with disappointment in every other aspect of our lives, we're willing to settle for something that is not only bad, but perhaps also not in out best interest.






Reading articles is something people do on the Internet. In fact, you're probably reading this article right now. But how can you be certain that you're reading this article right now? If you're not entirely sure you're reading this article right now, check out these signs.




Sensitivity be damned. Offending people may not work for everyone, but Urban Outfitters obviously feels it works for them -- surely they'll find more ways to offend. It's going to be hard to top a bloody Kent State sweatshirt, however.
The Greg Proops Film Club is a monthly show, a sort of film companion if you will, featuring Proops in front of a live audience that has gathered to watch one of his favorite movies.





Comedy isn't like baseball


Now Daddy loved gadgets... and when he was strolling through the huge Sears store on Main Street in Dothan, AL he came upon a Christmas Tree Flocking Kit. It was a fairly simple affair.
As part of his plan to degrade and destroy ISIS, President Obama has begun arming a moderate Syrian rebel.  Earlier this week the CIA certified that Husni al-Ziad, a middle-aged accountant living in Hama, was a \moderate rebel.\


After the recent outbreak of leaked nude celebrity photos, I took to the street to capture the thoughts of the people! Is it okay that these pics were released? Did people look at them anyway? All I know is that dick pics are in high demand.


My point is, the world expected more from Ridley Scott's Moses than an actor with great abs. Well, maybe not.


After a long period of silence, your friend Amanda has silently confirmed that the entire time you thought she was sitting there quietly listening, she was, in fact, judging you.




Don't appreciate close contact? No problem. The fanny pack creates a tangible boundary with anyone who likes to \hug it out.\


My part in this grand play is humble, but it is important.  As a stylist you can be sure that I also take your part very seriously, along with your length and color.


Guys, we don't want to go through all this suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.


We've lost some of our great comic minds lately - this is a wonderful opportunity to hear about the life and times of a comedy icon who is still quite lucid in his 80s, before it's too late.



In many ways bartending is like the French Foreign Legion; they are both challenging lifestyles, attracting a disparate and, let's face it, occasionally shady, bunch of characters.

On the surface, this would seem to be a clear-cut case of animal cruelty. Those geckos are dead because of the actions of some humans. But I think this case actually resides in more of a gray area because I think the geckos were willing participants.

I had to speak out. I mean, I'm a girl. And it would be totally gross if my pics were splashed everywhere. Especially when they were private! After the massive and perverted onslaught of leaked celebrity nude photos, the truth can't be held in much longer!






The soon-to-be Canadian Comedy Cult Classic, Jackhammer follows an actor Julian (played by Guy Christie) as he struggles after being blacklisted by a big-time theatre director. He reconnects with his estranged brother \Jackhammer\, a male stripper.

A sound was heard behind the Stop & Shop at 12:30 a.m. The store manager called 911 believing it was ISIS rebels. Police arrived at scene in a military Humvee. It was just a homeless man who had gotten into some garbage.







The United States is arguably the biggest kid on the worldwide block. We've got money, we've got power and lots of smart people -- heck, we've got Google headquarters. Who else has Google headquarters? We have all sorts of great things going for us. But today, the narrative is tainted.




Walmart is a scary place. It's like the convergence of Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompa Land with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest all rolled up into a gigantic chocolate-covered meatball.
I have an embarrassing confession. Last week I was invited to a Tupperware Party. That's not the embarrassing part. The embarrassing part is that I went. It was an invitation I didn't dare refuse.
After a seven-year streak, much to my dismay, Tuesday night was the final Chelsea Lately show. I have watched every episode of this show since it started, and even have some of my favorite episodes from years ago saved on my DVR.

Tired of waiting for others to make your plans? Had enough of disappointing afternoons? Now, there's another way. Now, you're in control. Now, there's Kinder.
I know I want a man that smells like work boots and I do love Mickey Rourke!
Every summer during the height of Florida's hurricane season, I wonder. I wonder if predictions of tropical quietude or cyclonic upheaval will validate meteorologists' year-to-year models, the computer-generated guesses I've dubbed \Little Big Storms.\
Incidentally I didn't come to L.A. for the medical marijuana. I came because I've been unable to fall in love in New York and I have Seasonal Affective Disorder.



















I came late to motherhood, as I came late to most things, like blooming and general adulthood. The craziness of my early 20s went on and on until I essentially spent 20 years being 20, and now that I'm 40, I'm doing what 20-somethings are supposed to do (chasing two preschoolers around).



Underneath the soft and fuzzy exterior are creatures who battle with their own demons. They are sentient beings who yearn to \get their krunk on\, crack a glow stick, and dance around their designer shoes. They are cats who love to party.
Gov. Rick Perry was indicted today on a felony count -- not for abuse of his power as governor -- but for wearing hipster glasses designed to make him look smarter and more sophisticated than he really is.







Unlike those big corporations, Mary's doesn't hate! Mary's simply wants to reward its favorite customers with a 15% discount. What could be wrong with that?







How do you react when you see a dick pick? Laugh? Gag? Analyze the lighting? Comedian Janet Silverman decided to look at 89 d*ck picks for the first time and record her reactions, which include all of those and more.




After repeated attempts for further explanation, Jones finally fessed up to what the grainy photos really represent.

Captain Conservative here. By day, I'm a mild mannered cable TV reporter for Fox News. By night, I'm a masked vigilante fighting for truth, justice, and traditional family values. And my bionic eyes don't like what they see going on in the Marvel Universe.



The podcast known as Harmontown is writer/show runner Dan Harmon's little corner of the world (along with Community and Rick & Morty and their attendant fan bases.)

As the Chicago skyline shone directly to my west, thousands of teens and 20-somethings wearing plastic wristbands streamed past me. Some waved open purses and backpacks in my direction, assuming I was there to inspect both. When I did neither, their pace quickened.
Portland-based writer Emma Higgins was shocked to discover that her favorite local writing spot, Caf\u00e9 Topia, finished writing its poignant memoir before Higgins could even make a dent in her fourth chapter.
Gentlemen, it time to rebrand. Start with the name. Change it from \The Middle East,\ to \The Middle Way.\ In focus group research, the former suggests violence, hostility and chaos while the later evokes tolerance, compromise and stability.
Here are nine hackneyed social observations you can test yourself against in order to determine if you're a witty social guru or merely a repetitive buffoon.



My husband works so hard that he often finds it difficult to keep his eyes open once he gets home. I decided to entertain myself while my better half caught some much deserved shut eye, and thus the Instagram account @MySleepingHusband was born.



How about individuals? Doesn't the same logic mandate that anybody named Manson or Hitler alter their name so as not to remind victims' relatives of their grisly crimes? Adolf? Charlie? What about Bush? Clinton? Kardashian?

Generally before I make any decisions in life, I ask myself one important question








Fox hunting. Why is that fun? I don't get it. The hounds do all the work. Why do they need you?

I want to take this opportunity to wish my mother, who turns a year older today, a very happy birthday, although I fear she won't have one.
How many of these faces do you recognize?

There's a lot more to Jeff Richards than people realize.  Over the past decade, the SNL and MADtv alum has been unleashing a series of experimental comedy electro-pop E.P.s accompanied by bizarre and hilarious music videos that harken back to the golden age of MTV when acts like M, Barnes & Barnes and Miss Julie Brown ruled the roost.

Poking fun at conservatives shouldn't be limited to SNL and Jon Stewart -- ALL our favorite shows can get in on the fun!


In summer, Bostonians head for the cape where they can languish on beaches in willful denial of the cold winter months to come. If you plan to sell a city property, this is probably not the best time to hit the market. But my friend Bob has stepped into the breach.
Researchers from the University of Chicago, taking a break from doing things like finding a cure for cancer or chronic chapped lips, decided to study the difference between love and lust.
\I'm still not sure exactly what happened,\ said gaffe-prone, beleaguered Secretary of State John Kerry, \but I'm told I agreed to sanctions on myself.\
The property market in Brazil appears to be heating up and, mark my words, I plan to dive in with the zeal of seasoned real estate pros like Donald Trump or that Barbara woman from Shark Tank.



It seems as if every day, regardless of what's going on in the world, Obama (or \this president\ as he is commonly called) is charged with pretty much the same things. So I will simplify the job.
While most any comedian can now spearhead a web series, few simultaneously tackle the challenges inherent in not only animating the content, but ensuring it maintains appeal for young and adult audience alike.

I mean, who doesn't want to try new things? The question is, however, do I want to do all of them again? The true merit lies in the willingness to try barbecued chicken testicles, not the eating of them every night. That's just weird.
It's time for America's favorite Internet game, Who Said It? Who said it -- Blink-182, Sum 41, or Malcolm X?



Conservatives are always outraged about something. A few weeks ago, we told you about the right-wing umbrage being tossed around -- not because of Obamacare -- but because of good old comic books. Well, for the conservative Comic-Con set, it's getting worse.

The attention given to Justin Harris, whose computer showed he'd read online about leaving children in a locked car and what it's like to serve time before his 22-month-old son was found dead in his car, made me anxious about searching for sites offering extra-marital affairs. I hope bloggers are given a pass.
If you haven't yet had your first cup of coffee, I urge you to think it through before you take that first sip. Coffee is unlike any other liquid on the planet.
Yes. Wonder Woman -- a fantastic character that stands in her own right as a member of the DC pantheon of Gods and on par with Superman and Batman. That to me is giving respect to minorities, not what Marvel Comics is doing.
I got my annual dose of humility this week when I attended the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen, an event that brings Wall Street and Silicon Valley elite together for three days of talks and networking. I've been to it four years in a row now, and it's always a good ego check for me.





In answer to the question, \Where's your Hobby Lobby song?\...


Some little girl told her father she wanted to be Cinderella, and her dad took her seriously, went out and claimed unchartered territory in Africa, and is now saying that his daughter is a f*cking princess. I'm 100% not kidding.




What's so new about The New Phil Hendrie Show, especially if it's already up to Episode 157 as of Monday this past week? The fact is that Hendrie is now a podcaster as opposed to being a broadcaster, which he was since 1973 when he got his first terrestrial radio gig outside Orlando, Florida.





Before my recent visit to Washington, D.C., a town populated by clueless people, so one more wouldn't hurt, I had been in the nation's capital twice -- once on purpose.
As a lifelong shark, I am thoroughly disgusted by the libelous statements this \victim\ is perpetrating in the media, and I'd like to use this opportunity to set the record straight.



Although he had wanted to give her the best high five of all, he missed and slapped her left tit instead. It was entirely by accident, but the result was that Courtney's monstrous jug popped like a balloon and everybody found out that it was, in actual fact, a pi\u00f1ata.



Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby that for-profit businesses with religious objections are no longer required to abide by the laws of an enlightened, first-world society.

If you're of the male persuasion, reading this article, you're hoping to find answers to why footwear seduces female's imaginations. The long and short of it is you have to get inside a woman's head, not just her pants.
The joke is that the bigger the gun, the tinier the penis, and while that may be absolutely, 100-percent true in every single case, there are other things guns compensate for. Here are eight of them.





A tsunami of tech is engulfing our nation, and in the process, redecorating communities like a family of grizzly bears locked in a Volkswagen Van. A family of obscenely paid bespectacled grizzly bears with a taste for artisanal toast.
Cue Sarah McLachlan vocal feels.

I mean, what's all the hype around this place? I've been here for three weeks already and I can't wait to get back home. Nothing cool. It's all, look
Very few people in this world actually show up on time to events. But for those who do, the struggle is very real.




I recently sat down with Lennon and Jessica on the eve of their two episode season finale to discuss what is different about how they write Playing House.






A lot can happen in 90 days. Your car's air conditioning can stop working at a moment's notice, providing your nether-regions to endlessly sweat like baked clams oreganata. You can get Hep C from some sketchy girl you met in the woods at a Tough Mudder event, or you can just do nothing -- like a European. And just enjoy yourself.


Let's face it










Needles to say, breaking up with my Blackberry was the best decision I have ever made. I'm a changed woman. This time around, it's all about ME and what I want.






I went to an existential strip club, where I spent a fortune on lap dances. But what does it all mean?




Regardless of what your kind-hearted family and friends and teachers have taught you to believe--life is not a marathon or a sprint, or a journey. It's a hunt. And hunting season has just begun. Congratulations. I hope you're hungry.

I feel sorry for rats; I really do. They supposedly make great pets, and their faces are every bit as cute as those of gerbils and mice. But there's just something about that tail -- that hairless, wormlike tail -- that creeps people out.
It is finally here! The wedding we have all been waiting for...or dreading -- Kim Kardashian marries Kanye West in Italy!
Why was Moby Dick white?








Prominent research psychologist and author Dr. Robert Epstein, age 60, was killed yesterday afternoon by a Google Street View vehicle while crossing Front Street in San Diego, where he has long resided.






The rules of the English language are gradually being reduced to mild suggestions, to be used only in the event of being in fifth grade.  For actual everyday life, which includes newscasts and TV talk shows, language is less dependable.




Debate aside, we have to ask
They're just looking for a connection, you guys.
Sure it sounds crazy, but just look at some of the lyrics to the classic Fats Domino song.
If you wasted your four precious undergraduate years having casual flings, making friends, or studying, there is only one solution


Tonight it's about you and me, Mom. I want to hear more about your craft projects, and how things are going since Dad left us for that young harlot. The basket of Buffalo wings upon which we shall snack will be tender and slightly sweet, much like your ever-patient care for me.




Fox's classic spy show, 24 is back. But nobody is mentioning where Jack Bauer was five years ago, when Dick Cheney was going on Fox News to defend enhanced interrogation.


Over at my telephone/internet/cable company, they play one lite jazz segment over and over. For more than an hour I listened to this ditty, all 30 seconds of it, before it repeated and repeated. It was minimalist hell.



Yeah. Easy to see how paying ladies the same wages as gentlemen could be considered condescending. Just like the 19th Amendment giving women the vote was obviously patronizing. And granting women control of their own bodies would be exceedingly supercilious.

Let me start, Facebook friends, by saying that I truly value each and every one of you. But now is the time to see who is really serious about our friendship and who cares enough to read my status updates all the way through.
Like most boys, I spent most of my down time drawing enormous breasts. I was, in fact, the Michelangelo of the well-doodled boob. We're talking breasts the size of Star Jone's head. They were not just drawings. Those breasts were my Super friends and I loved them.
When it was decided I would be making dinner for my man friend, my first thought was, \Well, I'll just wear something that shows a lot of skin so he's distracted from my potential lack of talent in the kitchen,\ which (obviously) inspired group-text conversations about \girl logic\ similar to that.
We're sitting on a red leather sofa in the lobby of the New York Athletic Club. My dad's wearing a blue and white pinstripe dress shirt, gold cufflinks and a salmon-colored tie. Best wing man ever.




In a world that focuses on instant gratification, I try to remind myself that things take time. Hey, I started out as a little guy myself. I didn't grow into this buff, handsome fella overnight -- it took time.
