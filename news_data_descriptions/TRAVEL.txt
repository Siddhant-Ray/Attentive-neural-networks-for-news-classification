International travel has been an love affair I've had for over the last dozen years or so, ever since my first international trip to Japan for my study abroad year in Tokyo in 2001-02. I had never stepped off of American soil until the age of 20 and I was ready to burst my bubble.
We all gathered for our second-to-the-last morning meeting and discovered that today was going to be an easy ride with only 70 miles to San Bernadino. This would be our last stop before making the final leap to the Santa Monica Pier.
You won't find a more kid-friendly resort on the island of Turks and Caicos than Beaches. With 10 pools, a beautiful beach, a water park, an Xbox Games Garage, a Sesame Street kids' camp, and even a DJ-spinning academy, the hotel is determined to rule out any inklings of boredom.

The Diary of a Young Girl was the first coming-of-age story I'd ever read. Thankfully, I got my hands on it years prior to a mandatory school assigned reading (as a young voracious reader, I ate those up too - but for some reason those assigned books always lacked shine). Anne's diary hit me hard.
These amazing destinations get me excited about all the possibilities and all the experiences that can be found around the world for a safari-lover like me.

Family travelers may think that hotel loyalty programs are just for business travelers who log dozens of nights on the road a year. But if you plan even one week-long vacation with your family a year it can pay off to join a loyalty program.

These luxury resorts across the U.S. will have you fantasizing about your next big trip.

We decided it was fine to be on our own today, as Jen had never been to this wonder of the world, and we wanted to spend more time there. Little did we realize however, the great distances we would be traveling and how little time we'd really have.

Thousands of pace\u00f1os line the city's beachfront as fierce Indians prance around against the eerie music of drums and flutes.

Flying is soaring between Heaven and Earth with a very real sense of mortality and responsibility. It is a balance of forces to create lift and a balance of focus to maintain attitudes.

Not all parks experience winter like the wonderland we see in movies, but the ones that do, are well worth the few added layers, just to gaze upon the sensational sparkling snow.
If you've ever traveled on a commercial jet, you probably know to avoid picking the middle seat in a row of three. If you purchase a last-minute ticket or you didn't select a seat before check-in, you might not have any other choice but to sit between two strangers on a long transcontinental flight, but assuming you do have your pick of where to sit, it's worth spending a few minutes to make sure you're getting the most bang for your buck.

Even all banged up from my bike accident, I felt the healing powers of traveling and being outdoors in nature. I knew two things


Though it's sometimes referred to as the \Las Vegas of the East,\ there's a whole lot more happening in Macau than slot tables. Originally a Portuguese trading post, Macau is a unique blending of two cultures that you can see--and taste--throughout the city.
Perched along the river of the same name, Hudson, New York was once the 24th largest city in the United States, an important trading post and site of Martin Van Buren's first law practice.
The best part about it? You're being rewarded for actions you might have done anyway. You'd likely post the photo of your family lounging by the hotel pool, so why not earn some points or perks in the process?
Things are always more special when you know their back stories. I noticed this same sort of phenomenon in Tanzania when we ate at an organic restaurant towards the end of the trip.
You've always imagined, even as a teenager, that most of your days would be spent commuting from the aforementioned suburban paradise to your workplace, so that you could just to come back home and do it all over again the next day.

Hotels inspire the horrific and macabre, and with Halloween almost upon us it's time to celebrate haunted rooms, menacing presences, poltergeists, and even the occasional Log Lady lurking in the lobby.
It's an old clich\u00e9 that Canada is entirely like the United States -- a sort of 51st state. Of course, it isn't. It has some qualities that are characteristically Canadian, not American. The \Capers,'' a  mix of Scottish, French, English, Irish and those whom Canadians call members of the \First Nations'' (our \Native Americans''), have a very strong regional identity.
The most important thing to remember is that flexibility means savings. If you can move your travel dates, departure times, and itinerary -- even just a little -- far more fares will be available to you, including those better suited to your budget.

Flying can be tense, and shrinking seat sizes don't help. In fact, research suggests that crowded flights can lead to a breakdown of normal social functioning among passengers. But flying doesn't need to bring out the worst in you.

After centuries of domination by its neighbors -- Belgium, Germany, and England -- Holland's brewers are finally picking up the mantle and forging a new, distinctive, Dutch path.


At what age should we start slathering on the creams to protect our skin from the dangerous UV rays? Is it enough to only use creams and lotions? Does it really expire after a year? And heck, are you supposed to wear sun-protective clothing all year?

America loves the Kansas City Royals. All the attention on the Royals has put a spotlight on this heartland city, nicknamed the City of Fountains.

Someday I'll go there. Someday I'll do that. Someday I'll have enough money and time for that trip. This is the internal monologue we have with ourselves. We let fear speak louder and louder until we succumb to it by staying comfortable within the areas that we can control.
It's almost that time of year again -- the holidays are quickly approaching and I'm getting the itch to take a quick trip for the winter.

Children with autism need to know what's going on, and about the environment that they're traveling to. Now you can do this two ways.

As a history buff I was pretty excited to visit Springfield, former home of Lincoln (easily in my top 5 of U.S. Presidents) and a slew of iconic Route 66 spots like the Cozy Dog Drive-In (home of the world's best corn dogs). Oh, and the chilli. Mustn't forget the chilli.
Forget everything you know about youth hostels -- the squeaky bunks, the communal baths, the dude from Poughkeepsie who's been backpacking for two weeks but has totally seen the world, man, and U.S. imperialism has, like, got to be stopped.
Whether you call it a pizza, pie or pizza pie, there's no denying New York City is home to some of the best in the country.

With so many shows to choose from, there's something for everyone in Las Vegas.
Summer has \officially\ ended (although we have all heard that before) and it was a blast. It seems to me like this was the fastest one yet due to the vast amount of traveling that occurred.
Breathtaking and frail, this dangerous landscape is completely off-limits to all tourists, and rumored to house strange and undocumented animal species, dinosaur migration trails, unexplored caverns and cave systems, and possibly bandits hiding away from civilization.
There is something to be said about the road less traveled. It opens up your eyes and greets you with opportunities and experiences you wouldn't have otherwise. I'm writing specifically about a trip that I took this past summer into the far reaches of Eastern Montana.
I had high expectations for my visit to Discovery Cove. First and foremost, this is right up my alley. I love everything ocean and animal related, especially hands-on experiences.

Oktoberfest is one of Germany's greatest cultural exports. Yet every time I mentioned it to German friends in Berlin, I was met with eye rolls and groans.
There are many smaller, closer-to-home islands that are loaded with local charm without the high price tag (or long plane ride).
Copenhagen in the autumn is an especially good idea.  The weather is good, the tourists are gone (except for you, of course) and you can get into some of the best restaurants without waiting for days or even week.
This time the idea is for  a glorious boat trip north up the coast of Labrador in a 'luxury cabin' aboard the Northern Ranger ferry to the little villages of Nunatsiavut, the province's  autonomous Inuit area, which means 'our beautiful land' in Inuit.
When it comes to the mechanically cooled contemporary American South, this may be close to blasphemy. But here goes





Looking at my half packed suitcase as I write this and I might be repeating others but here are my tips for 'savvy' travelling.
This world is so full of awesomeness like great food, music, beautiful arts and gorgeous buildings. I wouldn't want to swap these things for some elusive, intangible goal of finding myself.

Being a grown-up -- rather than a toddler --  means recognizing that world doesn't revolve around you. All your needs won't always be met. The needs of others matter too. And if your needs are in conflict? You communicate.

The air is cooling (finally!), the kids are back in school, our favorite sweaters are coming out of storage, and all the trees are starting to change color. We love it -- with one, crucial caveat. We're city dwellers, and access to the vividly color-changing outdoors can sometimes be... well... limited.
Maybe it's their permissive attitude toward public nudity. Maybe they just understand that tan lines are as offensive as taking selfies on the shore. Whatever the reason, topless (not to mention full-on nude) beaches in Europe are plentiful.

My mission was to put together an itinerary that was heavy on the cold weather fun, but minus the downhill activities that most folks come to the Rocky Mountains to enjoy.
I was discussing an upcoming New Orleans trip with friend and fellow foodie Jessica Collins. She said \When I took my first bite of turtle soup at Commander's Palace, I knew there was no other city I could be in than New Orleans.\ Truer words have never been spoken.
