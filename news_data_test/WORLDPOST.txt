Weekend Roundup. Pent-up democratic aspirations were unleashed this week in Myanmar's first free election in decades, resulting in a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi and her opposition party. But as Mark Famaner and Hanna Hindstrom point out, it is \democracy on a leash\ as the long-standing military rulers retain a constraining foothold through the current constitutional arrangement. It remains to be seen if Suu Kyi's elected government will be \above\ those constraints, as she has boldly asserted. Writing from Yangon, Ma Thida lays out the many issues in the political transition ahead.\n\nHarrison Akins reminds us that the \shadow\ over Myanmar's democratic turn is the continuing persecution and discrimination against the Muslim Rohingya minority. \n\nIf it stabilizes, Myanmar could have a bright future. It sits between the two fastest growing economies in the world, India and China, the second of which is revitalizing the ancient Silk Road trading route that George Yeo, Singapore's former foreign minister, sees as making Eurasia the driver of the future global economy.

Weekend Roundup.

Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy, Xi wants to leap over the \middle-income trap\ in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that, he needs to avoid, in his own words, the \Thucydides trap\ of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.

Weekend Roundup. Ancient Greece was not only the birthplace of democracy, but also a deathbed of reason when a jury of 500 citizens condemned Socrates to die by hemlock poisoning for his impious attitude toward the order of the day. Defiant to the end, the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity.\n\nThis weekend, Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity, imposed by the jury of other European democracies, or, like Socrates, administer their own poison in a \no\ vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy, too, such as we are witnessing today, had its origins in early Greek drama.\n\nNobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand. As they point out by examining the Argentine default in 2001, there is \life after debt and default.\ Manolis Glezos, the elderly firebrand of Syriza, writes from Athens that, in a democracy, \the people are the measure\ of their fate.

Erdogan Scores an Own Goal. Turkey is a radically different exemplar from Egypt. It says political differences can be mediated.

Understanding the Islamic State. Either way, it underscores the fact that Islamic State does not fit into any neat pigeon holes. It may be a proto-nation or even the core of a new proto-empire.

Leveraging Sanctions with Iran.

Nor is it reasonable to hang one's hat on the belief that Iran will moderate its behavior if both its diplomatic and financial isolation is ended.

Abe's Visit Will Remind Americans China's Power Must Be Checked. TOKYO -- Would a world order designed by China allow for the rise of another power to challenge it in the way the U.S.-led world order allowed for -- indeed, encouraged and assisted -- China's three-decade-long boom? To answer that question, one can look to the writings of the Chinese strategist Yan Xuetong, whose book \Ancient Chinese Thought, Modern Chinese Power\ argues that all countries must recognize and accept China's centrality to the world as the Middle Kingdom.

Working With the Marginalized in Poland. Until the 1970s, drug addicts didn't exist in Poland -- at least not officially. In those days, drugs were expensive and the supply was limited, so the Polish state could hide the problem by giving a different label to the small number of addicts. But then heroin became more readily available. And addiction started to grow.
Why Iran Matters to South Korea -- and Why South Korea's Middle East Posture Should Matter to the United States. n 2009, North Korea declared that it had developed a nuclear weapon.

Weekend Roundup. Since Earth Day, which will be marked on April 22, was first commemorated 45 years ago, we have learned a lot about the planet's ecology. Above all, we have begun to understand the biological intelligence of nature itself that, for millennia, has managed to continually regenerate and stabilize that narrow band of a livable climate that has enabled our species and others to thrive.\n\nWorking with nature, not against it, to combat climate change is the message of the Leo DiCaprio-narrated short video documentary, \Restoration,\ we publish this week. As senior Chinese diplomat Wu Jianmin writes from Beijing, we are also learning to work together as nations through geo-environmental cooperation, as exemplified by the recent U.S.-China agreement to jointly reduce carbon gases.

Denial of the Armenian Genocide Is Brutalizing the World. JERUSALEM -- That the acknowledgment of the genocide by the pope and Kim Kardashian's trip to Armenia were so newsworthy and were hailed as such a great \PR disaster for Turkey\ shows that something went terribly wrong over the course of the last century.
Somalis Become Victims of Al-Shabaab's Violence Twice Over. The attacks of Al-Shabaab have been portrayed as a fight between Kenyans and Somalis.

Ukraine, Politics of History and Jewish Identity.

Acknowledging the Armenian Genocide. It is wrong to say to just \get over it\ to victim nations. For there to be reconciliation, there must be acknowledgment and justice.

Iran Nuclear Deal Pits U.S. Congress Versus U.S. Allies?. The most serious challenge to the nuclear deal may be that it does not at all address the human rights record of the Tehran theocracy or statements challenging the legitimacy of Israel.

You Can't Understand What's Really Going on in Yemen Without Busting These Myths. The threats emanating from Yemen are distorted and exaggerated, the stakes are actually relatively low (except for Yemenis), any imposed settlement is highly elusive and the costs to those engaged may be high.

The Bright Future of Asia's Middle Class. SEOUL -- Equipped with high-quality education, Asia's rising middle class will demand higher-quality public services. Increased confidence in their country's political systems and institutional structures, enhanced by improved perceptions of upward mobility, will help to strengthen the rule of law. And there will be more opportunities for women to learn and work, leading to greater gender equality.

The Sage of Singapore. Though the founding father of a tiny country on the tip of the Malay peninsula, Lee Kuan Yew was one of the giants of the arriving Asian century. Not only did he miraculously transform the impoverished colonial entrep\u00f4t of Singapore, rife with drugs and prostitution, into a gleaming model city-state of the 21st century; his practical vision of soft-authoritarian capitalism also became the template for Deng Xiaoping's \opening up and reform\ in China, laying the basis for the rise of a prosperous East Asia.

Lee Kuan Yew's Legacy. Lee Kuan Yew died on Monday at the age of 91.

Weekend Roundup. TOKYO -- Looking out onto Tokyo's towering neon cityscape, it is difficult to imagine the utter devastation of Japan's capital 70 years ago this week in one of the world's greatest overlooked atrocities -- the unsparing American firebombing that incinerated more people than either of the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima or Nagasaki. In this respect, Japan is a long way from its past.\n\nBut a visit to Tokyo this week by German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- during which she noted how her country had accepted culpability for its WWII fascist aggression in a way that Japan has not -- also highlights how the past still shadows the present -- and the future -- in Asia. (In Europe also the past has returned from another angle as Greece is demanding reparations from Germany). (continued)

Angela Merkel, as chancellor of Europe's unrivaled power, has become, for better and worse, the crisis manager in the middle. (continued)
Looking Beyond the Crisis. In Europe, as in the BRICS and other countries that experienced rapid growth during the expansive phase of the cycle, we are now in the phase when the down side of the curve teems with uncertainties that discourage decisions to invest.

Instead of Seeking Revenge, We Must Fight ISIS by Advancing Ideologies of Human Solidarity. The sensationalist tendencies of our contemporary global media have offered an ideal echo chamber for the warped and corrupt ideologies of these militant groups. We must better utilize this echo chamber to put forth convincing ideologies that strengthen the possibility for human solidarity.
A Bridge Too Far. Russia and Iran are in bed together and keep hammering away at the same theme--America is the enemy. America and NATO cannot afford to cede Ukraine to Russia and also cannot tolerate a nuclear armed Iran exporting terror around the globe.

How Purpose Can Regain Trust. For many of us who attended this year's World Economic Forum, the issue of trust dominated much of the discussion. Despite the improving global economy, trust in global institutions among the world's population is at an all-time low.
All We Are Saying, Is Give Greece a Chance. The Greek people voted overwhelmingly for a new start. But Prime Minister Tsipras cannot deliver that new start alone. He needs help from World leaders and Europe's other leaders and the involved Eurozone officials, easing up the strict -- non-workable rules imposed -- on the Greek people.
The Many Faces of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Weekend Roundup. The savagery of the Islamic State taunted the world once again this week, striking out at both geopolitically toothless Japan and the tribal kingdom of Jordan. Islamic State fighters beheaded the journalist Kenji Goto and revealed that, in an act of unfathomable cruelty, they had burned alive a captured Jordanian pilot.\n\nLast week Japan's former defense chief Yuriko Koike wrote from Tokyo that Japan's constitutional restrictions on using force have prevented it from taking action against ISIS, and argues that that must change. Writing from Beirut, Jordanian analyst Rami Khouri has political misgivings about official support across the Arab world for the anti-ISIS coalition when the public is not consulted. From Amman, WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones reports both on the massive protests against ISIS and on the undercurrent of opposition in Jordan that believes the fight against ISIS \is not our war.\ (continued)

How Ancient Chinese Thought Applies Today. In the absence of a common narrative shared by the U.S. and China, the two nations are likely to drift more rapidly apart. The relationship needs a new strategic concept for the future that is capable of sufficiently embracing both American and Chinese realities, as well as areas of potential common endeavor for the future, and to do so in language which is comprehensible and meaningful in both capitals. Trust builds on itself just as distrust builds on itself as well, compounding into deep enmity over time.

Charlie-Hebdo, France's Secularism, Islam, and Us All. From now on, what will be at stake is no longer our future ability as Westerners to coexist on a planet scale with the \Muslim other\ after the question of \why do they hate us,\ but rather our ability, and without too much compromise on mutual ethos, to live together within Western societies for the century or more to come.
The Familiar Yet 'Forgotten' Tragedy of Hama. On February 2, 1982, Syrian troops -- acting under the orders of then-President Hafez al-Assad and led by his brother, Rifaat al-Assad -- besieged the city of Hama in an effort to quell an anti-government uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Long Judicial Arm of the Honduran Coup. Rather than reward the dangerous Hern\u00e1ndez regime for subverting the rule of law and punishing those who uphold it, the United States should publicly and forcefully demand the immediate reinstatement of the four judges as a baby step toward restoring judicial independence in Honduras.

Breasts on Facebook. In real life, I was able to appeal this decision, but with you, we cannot click on an \appeal\ tab. And since I am a feminist, I cannot stop myself from noticing male chests circulating all over your site without consequence and receive your narrow-minded precepts like a discriminatory slap in the face.

Why Pope Francis Is Very Much Like St. Francis. In the conclave, Pope Francis touched on the early church fathers' sense of the mysterium lunae. The mystery of the moon is that it has no light of its own; it only reflects the light of the sun. He said the church should not mistake itself for the sun. It has instead the mystery of the moon. It must remember that it only shines by reflecting the light of the divine.

In the Wake of Charlie Hebdo Attacks, France Must Look Beyond 9/11 Response.

Weekend Roundup. No sooner did the global elites leave their annual talking shop high in the Alps at Davos last week than the people spoke in Greece. In a mutiny against an untenable status quo, those who are run over have revolted against those who run things. Now righteous populism must face economic, financial and political realities if other European states don't bend Greece's way.\n\nTo keep up with the drama as it evolves over the coming weeks, we've connected WorldPost readers directly to the daily blog of Yanis Varoufakis, the self-described \erratic Marxist\ who is now Greece's finance minister. Writing from Athens, HuffPost Greece Editorial Director Sophia Papaioannou says Alexis Tsipras' electoral victory will give suffering Greeks \space and time\ to address their predicament. Former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou argues that the path forward after the election is for a national referendum on a \Greek plan\ for reform that will bind a now polarized nation. Rena Dourou, a deputy of the victorious Syriza party, notes that the vote was as much against the corruption of the formerly ruling political parties in Greece as it was against austerity.

The Relationship With Saudi Arabia Is the Starting Point for U.S. Long-term Interests.

Hostage Crisis Shows How Japan Fails to Protect Its Citizens -- And What It's Doing About It. TOKYO -- It is unacceptable for a government to be unable to protect its own citizens. That is why Abe is determined to amend, or at least reinterpret, Japan's constitution to allow for the kinds of defense maneuvers that other countries, from Israel to India, employ when their people are threatened. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson once put it, a constitution is not a suicide pact.

Weekend Roundup. The WorldPost was launched one year ago in Davos. It was born out of a contradiction and a paradox. \n\nThe contradiction is that while the world is growing more interdependent, the media is fragmenting -- re-nationalizing, re-localizing and even tribalizing. The resulting paradox is that the information age is becoming the age of non-communication across boundaries -- political, cultural and ideological.\n\nThe aim of The WorldPost is to help bridge this growing chasm by becoming a platform where the whole world meets; a common zone where cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives from all corners of the planet can take place.\n\nTo achieve this aim, The WorldPost strives for a global viewpoint looking around, not a national perspective looking out. Along with intelligent curation of the global news and original reportage, what distinguishes us, above all, are the first person global voices of our contributors. Every week, they weigh in as events break from Havana to Beijing, from Moscow to Mexico City, Paris, New Delhi and Abuja among so many other places.\n\nThe WorldPost seems to have met an outstanding need. Thanks to you, one year later we have reached 28 million monthly views. We've shown that the message can catch up to the medium if we put our minds to it. (continued)

Weekend Roundup. The first principle of an open society is not to let the intolerant define \the territory of insult\ -- those areas off limits to criticism or ridicule. But how does one define \territory\ when media now crosses the boundaries of nations, cultures and civilizations?\n\nIn the end, free societies must defend the right of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists against murder by fanatics, the Sony filmmakers against the North Korean regime and novelists like Salman Rushdie against a fatwa from the ayatollahs. But isn't Pope Francis also right that, in today's diverse and connected world, we must exercise the civil restraint of \respect\ for the non-fanatic faithful (see the other depiction of the Prophet acceptable among some Muslims on left above), even if we insist on irreverence toward political authority?\n\nFinding an equilibrium amid the frictions and fusions that abound in this global public space will determine whether or not we can forge a new cosmopolitan commons of the 21st century.\n\nThis week, The WorldPost engages this conundrum. Writing from Denmark, Flemming Rose, the Jyllands-Posten editor who commissioned cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad a decade ago that set off riots across the Muslim world, argues against \the tyranny of silence\ fanatics would impose. Mehdi Hasan says he is \fed up with free speech fundamentalists\ who feel they have a \duty to offend.\ (continued)

Iran. Taking a journey through centuries of history in today's Isfahan, you will encounter extremely warm people. Iranian hospitality is phenomenal. From the reception desk at the Abbasi hotel, built by the Sultan Husayn of Safavid some 300 years ago, everybody greets you with warmth.
The NYT's Limitless Ignorance of Bangladesh Trials. One doesn't expect the world's leading -- and liberal -- paper to take a stance that goes effectively against a court in a Third World country that's struggling against great historic odds to bring genocidal killers to justice.
PK -- A Masterstroke Off Hirani's Canvas. Khan and his versatility never fails to impress. PK is one of those movies which no matter how many times one watches, it is bound to enthrall.
Russia. For several years now, I've tried to temper satirical criticism of the occasional excess in Russia's political culture with the concern that I'm reducing a complex system of government to the latest installment of News of the Weird.

Obama Gives Cuba a Hemispheric Coup. The recent political witch-hunt against famed Venezuelan opposition legislator Maria Corina Machado reinforces growing concerns that democratic institutions are under concerted attack in the Western Hemisphere.
What Happened to Poland's Red Capitalists?. In Poland in the late 1980s, Polish sociologist Jadwiga Staniszkis began writing about \political capitalists.\ These were colloquially known as \red capitalists\ -- technocrats and enterprise managers who were technically part of the Communist system but had already begun to function like capitalists.
President Obama Has Created A Dangerous Precedent In Cuba. President Obama not only handed Castro a huge propaganda victory, but also created a dangerous precedent by signaling our enemies that major policy concessions can be gained by taking an American hostage.
To Mourn Charlie Hebdo, Stop Making Excuses for Terrorism. In summary, if our hearts truly bleed for the dead in Paris, then let's stop throwing out platitudes and flawed logical explanations for the slaughter and instead address the serious problem that the attacks represent -- pure, unrelenting, and unmitigated evil that must be destroyed.
The Conflict Has Come to Us. The attack in Paris has presented a much more important problem -- while we continue to discuss the nature of this ongoing conflict, the conflict has come to us. And it has found us unprepared.
French Prime Minister. 
Terrorists' Web of Hate Extends Far Beyond France. Among the extremist connections to terrorist brothers Cheriff, 32 and Said Kouachi, 34 are fellow radical French Algerians as well as those in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
#JeSuisCharlie? No, I'm Not Charlie Hebdo. Nothing -- no cartoon, no book, no song -- justifies the kind of shooting rampage that happened in Paris. As Hassen Chalghoumi, the imam of Drancy mosque in Paris says, \These are criminals, barbarians. They have sold their souls to hell.\
There Are More French Muslims Working for French Security Than for Al Qaeda. Muslims are criticized for being a community, but then asked to react against terrorism as a community. This is called the double bind
Charlie Hebdo and Europe's Rising Right. Officer Merabet was there to guard Charlie Hebdo.  That is duty.  That is bravery. That is the defense of free speech.  He belongs to a larger France, and a better Europe.
A Silver Lining for Charlie Hebdo. You can see clearly here at least one area where the attackers failed -- instead of dividing different groups of people, they indirectly united them in their condemnation of the horrific assault.
Weekend Roundup. Europe is facing divisive challenges on all fronts. It is being torn within by hardening attitudes toward the growing presence not only of Muslim immigrants, but also of citizens. On Monday, demonstrators thronged the streets of Dresden in support of \Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the Occident.\ On Wednesday in Paris, 12 people were killed, including cartoonists who lampooned the Prophet Muhammad, in the horrific Charlie Hebdo attack.\n\nWhile the euro tumbles, northern and southern Europe are bitterly at odds over austerity policies and continuing high unemployment. And a newly aggressive Russia is challenging European values on its eastern frontier. (continued)\n\nWriting from Berlin, Alexander Gorlach analyzes what is behind rising Islamphobia in Europe.  From Paris, Le Huffington Post editorial director Anne Sinclair pays homage to the slain journalists. \Infidel\ author Ayaan Hirsi Ali warns that we can't let political Islamists define the territory of insult. Akbar Ahmed looks at the long history, and present social conditions, of Muslims in Europe.
Charlie Hebdo. The Charlie Hebdo killings, whatever their connections to the current wars in the Middle East, were acts of terrorism that should be handled by law enforcement.
Syria. It should be clear after four bloody years in Syria that if we are to make any progress moving forward, it is necessary to shed illusions and fantasies that have shaped too much of the discussion about the conflict.

Turkish Leftist Group Retracts Claim Of Responsibility For Istanbul Bomb Attack. 
What the Paris Attack Is Really About (Hint -- Neither Free Speech Nor the Varied Nature of Muslims). Both of these large points are true in general, perhaps to the point of banality. Yet the first is too general and the second too specific. Both conceal real nuances that are important to moving policy discussions forward.
Charlie Hebdo Suspects Killed. 
Charb's Partner Speaks About His Death. 
Saudi Courts Should Exhibit Independence by Protecting Speech. While the driving ban has lit up the Internet, it is only a symptom of a system that is insufficiently responsive to widely-held Saudi opinion on matters of governance. For the Saudi judicial system to show itself to be truly independent, it should support a more open discourse on future social and legal policy in the Kingdom.
The Middle East in Transition and Korea's Foreign Policy Toward the Middle East. In a larger strategic context, our two regions are connected through U.S. global strategy. America's rebalance to East Asia cannot be divorced from events in the Middle East, as they could affect the available strategic assets in East Asia.
China's Grand Strategy. Far from being an empty rhetorical effect, Xi Jinping's New Silk Road will not only be one of the most discussed topics of 2015, but it will profoundly mark China's coming decade and reshape Eurasia.
Analyzing the Paris Terror Attack. Such solidarity will send a clear message that civil liberties, particularly freedoms of speech and the press, will not be compromised, undermined or intimidated by acts or threats of violence.
Parallels in Myanmar and Cuba Policy. This seems like a laundry list of \gives,\ but these are in fact incremental steps -- particularly given that the embargo remains in force -- that will improve the everyday lives of Cubans and their families abroad and begin to thaw relations between the two countries.
Law and Disorder in the South China Sea. Owing to its glaring conventional military inferiority, the Philippines has embarked on an unprecedented journey
Chess in a Conflict Zone. The lone American in the trailer leans over the students to study their moves, his Syrian translator practically attached to his hip. The Karam Leadership Program identification card hanging around his neck sways side-to-side as he points out a strategic mistake.

The Beam in One's Own Eye. This reported phrase from the Sermon on the Mount aimed at hypocrisy comes to mind as I contemplate the \furious\ reaction of Pakistani officials at the portrayal of their country and their countrymen in the TV series Homeland.
Israel's Bedouin Schools Thrive in Negev Desert. In the sandy dunes of the northern Negev desert between Arad and Be'er Sheva, 130 students who belong to a local Bedouin tribe, study at the Al-Sayed Technological School. The students come from a weak socio-economic background and a great number of students suffer from learning disabilities as a result of inter-family marriages.
How Iran Can Escape Its Nuclear Deadlock with the U.S.. It should be mentioned that in response to my protest against massive vote rigging during the first election of the parliament after the Revolution, Khomeini told me in a private conversation that people have no vote whatsoever and that we only conduct such elections in order to close the mouths of Westerners.
Photographing the Young Monks of Myanmar. After picking up my visa and exchanging some U.S. dollars for kyat I stepped out of the airport into the steam that is Yangon, Myanmar, during the monsoon season.\nA time of year good for photographers to avoid those unsightly tourists that invade a viewfinder during picture taking or worse not seen until the proofs appear on screen.
New Appraisals of Violent Extremism. Not all those heeding Daesh's call are lunatics; some could be diverted by counter-messaging that offers alternatives to violence. Reaching these young men and women might accomplish more than countless air strikes can achieve. This is the true heart of the struggle against violent extremism.
China's Most Sensational Trial in Decades. Given the fact that Zhou also happened to be a political adversary of President Xi, and lost a vicious power struggle on the eve of China's leadership transition in 2012, there are lingering doubts about the motives behind sending this \mega-tiger\ (a corrupt top Chinese leader) to jail.
Ukraine's Donbas Is Like America's Deep South. The United States could eventually overcome Jim Crow laws because Washington was stronger than the Deep South. As long as Russia supports the Donbas Deep South -- and that is likely to be for a long time -- Ukraine will be too weak to grant it autonomy or to absorb it.
Is Economic Warfare the Theme for 2015?. Is the Russian Ruble becoming financial rubble as consequence of targeting by the U.S. and its allies? The dramatic fall in oil prices and commensurate drop\u00a0in the Russian currency, is this coincidental to broader global economic trends or an orchestrated assault?

Setting Benchmark in Battle for Statehood. Palestine has set a new benchmark for nations like the Kurds and the Kosovars who see soccer as a key part of their toolbox to achieve statehood with its qualification for this month's Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup even if the Palestinian road to statehood is increasingly pockmarked by seemingly insurmountable barriers.

Let's make 2015 a banner year.
How Obama Moved the Cuba Needle. Most of the foreign-policy establishment concluded long ago that Washington's policy of hostility toward Havana made no sense, but because Cuba was a low priority issue during Obama's first term, establishment figures rarely spoke out about it -- until they began to sense that the policy was in flux.
\No, We Have No Illusions That It Will Be Easy\. Since December 17, Cuba has not been the same. Discussions, questions and expectations have multiplied among us since the announcement from Barack Obama and Raul Castro about the reestablishment of relations between the United States and Cuba.
Cuban Political Police Crush Free Speech, Days After US Diplomatic Opening. The project to reenact the performance, but this time in the Plaza of the Revolution, invariably brought back to us memories of that night in the Wilfredo Lam center and the hope that this time the microphones would be open to a larger number of Cubans.

Palestine and the International Criminal Court. Membership in the ICC would give Abbas another tacit endorsement of statehood and the ability to wage powerful lawfare. But will this really get Abbas what he ultimately wants? Or better, what does he want?
In 2015, Let's Not Punish the Palestinians for Joining the ICC. It's kind of funny, in a not ha-ha way, how twisted the public discourse in the U.S. is, that we even have to defend the proposition that the Palestinians should join the ICC if they want. But we do.
CIA Torture's Immeasurable Damage to U.S. Global Leadership. The CIA was never among the world's most trusted global brands, even among U.S. allies, but torture revelations have diminished U.S. claims to moral leadership and reduced its \soft power.\
Population Boom and the Economic Impact in a New Year. The reality is, countries are not poor because of how many people they have, they are poor because of economic policies.
Not That Healthy. Poor governance, marked by rising income inequality, corruption and lack of accountability, additionally challenges the sustainability of Cuba's universal health-care scheme. Havana ranks 75th in the annually-published Global Peace Index, a metric that attempts to quantify effective governance in a variety of sectors, putting it on par with troubled countries like Djibouti, Nepal and Malawi.

Can the Middle East Be Fixed?. The Middle East is one of the world's most strategically significant regions. Stunningly, perhaps, the region does not yet have in place the necessary institutions and mechanisms to discuss and manage, and to prevent and respond to crises. Strategic and visionary leadership is required to reverse the state of the region.

The U.S., Cuba, and Strategic Foreign Policy. If you ask me, Obama's action on Cuba was a master stroke, and full of foresight. He has undercut Putin's ability to use Cuba as a pressure point against the U.S. going forward and has, in a single action, transformed a net negative for the U.S. and Cuba into a net positive for its government, people, and businesses.
Behind Cuba's Opening to the U.S.. For anyone who can still see straight, it is obvious that Venezuela won't be able to keep on subsidizing the Castro regime with 100,000 daily oil barrels.

Doha Summit a Major Turning Point in Gulf March. This will be the summit that will lay out new policy orientations different from the previous ones that accompanied the wave of revolutions for change in the Arab region.
PM Netanyahu Outsmarts Himself. The day after the elections will be Netanyahu's utmost test of leadership during his entire career. The man knows the world, he knows the US, he understands world economics, so the big question is, can he REALLY be genuine in his push towards new elections?
A Cultural Psychosis. This is a continuation of my last post, \System Failure,\ addressing the issue of Domestic Violence in Trinidad & Tobago. My hope is that if we persist in shining a light here, refusing to let it be swept under the rug of deliberate ignorance any longer, it will effect some positive change.
30 Years Later, Those Responsible for India's Bhopal Disaster Must Be Held Accountable. It is neither justice nor equality when a U.S. company can evade accountability for the deaths of thousands of people in India.
Saving Culture Is Essential for Building Peace. I went to Erbil, to stand with the people of Iraq, to defend their unique heritage and diversity and to say that this matters - not just for Iraq's future but for all women and men. We must defend the idea of a shared humanity wherever it is challenged. This is our struggle.
Non-Dollar Trading Is Killing the Petrodollar -- And the Foundation of U.S.-Saudi Policy in the Middle East. This new oil price drop simply is crushing producers' currencies in foreign exchange markets. The combination of the petrodollar losing its ability to act as a store of value, combined now with exchange rate blues, may be the straw that breaks the producer \camel's back\ in respect to OPEC and dollar denomination. Such a moment would seem ripe for Russia and Iran to begin a gradual challenge to Saudi's leadership of the OPEC cartel and to the dollar-denominated energy system, if enough OPEC members and other producers are prepared to rebel. Iran has been lobbying hard in this direction.
Rising to End FGM - Agnes Pareyio. When women stand up and defend themselves, it works. Remember -- in 1975, 98% of women were mutilated just like I was. Today, it is 27%. That's 27% too many, but it's also the sign of a revolution. It wasn't handed down on high.
Taking Back California's Direct Democracy from Special Interests. Together, these reforms will improve the quality of our initiatives and our direct participation. They create what in political science circles is known as an \indirect initiative effect\ -- a role for the legislature to foster public comment and active debate, to highlight errors and unintended consequences and fix them, and perhaps to craft policy solutions via legislation.
What the US Owes Afghanistan. US involvement in the war in Afghanistan may be coming to an end, but US commitment to improving human rights in Afghanistan should not.
Will Russia's Eastern Game Plan Work?. Russia's projected growth of the economy in 2015 will not surpass 1% by even the most optimistic projections. What does Russian leadership do to mend this sinking boat?
Why Remembering Jewish Refugees Matters. The story of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands is little known, but has huge repercussions for today.
On the International Day for Solidarity with the Palestinian People. If the world community were serious about honoring its commitments as articulated by the UN secretary general, it would move much faster to declare the state continuing a 47-year occupation a pariah state.
The Hunt for Terrorist Leaders. Targeted killings remain a useful tactical tool in the kit of counterterrorism strategists. While they cannot be expected in the long run to paralyze a terrorist organization, they often can bring short-term, intense pressure on a successor's operations. They cannot bring an end to terrorism.
Hollywood, Chinese Censors Win In TV Anti-Piracy Campaign. 
Our Common Real World. I am about to conclude my visit to  Smyrna. I am sitting at my balcony, overlooking the bay. This  was my second visit this year in this beautiful, cosmopolitan and liberal city. I participated as a panelist for the symposium organized by Izmir's Mediterranean Academy.

The Ebola Response. If this is the most critical public health crisis of our time, it also presents the most compelling ethical challenges for governments, international organizations and international NGOs.
The Arab and Iranian Disconnect. Arabs should be reassured that their concerns are understood by the West. At the same time, the Iranian public needs to see the linkage between their economic woes and their government's nuclear ambitions and foreign policy.
U.S. Should Talk to North Korea, Whoever Is in Charge. Every strategy toward the DPRK so far seems to have failed.  Anything adopted is likely to be only a second best. However, today even second best would be a major step forward. It's time for Washington to try something different.
Obama Faces the Test of Emerging Out of the Gray Zone. President Barack Obama may be forced to move away a little from his policy of non-clarity, because he will not be able to win the war he declared against ISIS as long as he relies on mystery.

5 Positive Things Around The World To Be Thankful For. 
Hong Kong Student Leaders Banned From Key Protest Site. 
The Battle for Islam. Does the situation of present-day Muslim society, marked by crisis, tensions, foreign interventions and political despotism, foster the reformist democratic Islam, or does it promote its violent and theocratic rivals?
Victor Pinchuk, Mistral Warships, and the Jews of Ukraine. On Nov. 18, in Kiev, philanthropist Victor Pinchuk was awarded the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Medal of Honor by the Jewish Confederation of Ukraine for his contributions to Ukrainian-Jewish understanding and cooperation. What follows is a version of my remarks at the ceremony.
Qatar Said To Run A Covert Training Camp For Syrian Rebels With U.S. Help. 
Egypt, Israel and the Palestinians. It is the interest of Israel to have Egypt play a significant role in any future settlement with the PA, and clearly to accept it will require a change of the disc also in Jerusalem.
An \Alive\ Andes Hero Gives Thanks, and Thoughts. Leading into the Thanksgiving season, something in the bareness of the trees and drop in temperature made me think of my cousin, Roberto Canessa, one of the two \Alive\ survivors that climbed a 14,774-foot headwall to save himself, his friends and, he explained on the phone, his mother waiting in Uruguay.
Will Greater Israel Transform Into Greater Palestine?. If the slaughter in the Jerusalem synagogue will make the Palestinian dream of statehood an even more unreachable dream, it will also turn Israel's illusion of the sustainability of the occupation into a nightmare.
Asia Is on the Brink of a Golden Era. Here's Why.. Asia has been infected by a silent, healthy virus of modernization. There is a remarkably wide and deep consensus among regional leaders that they should focus on modernization and pragmatic development. Because it is silent, the Western media has not noticed and continues to predict doom.
Moving the Needle Forward on Women's Rights in Afghanistan. Afghanistan has changed significantly since the fall of the Taliban, and the ways in which Afghans view themselves and their country continue to evolve.
Give Me Your Dreamers That Are Searching For Purpose. Too many qualified foreign students are sent home after graduation. Indeed the gap between student and temporary employment visa issuances has widened extensively over the past decade.

Turkish President Says Women And Men Can't Be Equal. 
Don't Prop up Putin by Giving Him an Enemy. Putin's post-Soviet regime may be approaching a crucial tipping point in its level of domestic support. Let's hope that the United States doesn't take his bait, and inadvertently prop him back up by giving him a military enemy to fight against.

Powerful Portraits Of Ebola Survivors Back Home And Still Fighting To Live. 
Mexico's President Forced into a Corner. The government is now afraid to use public force to prevent demonstrators from blockading roads and streets, stealing buses and trucks, ransacking supermarkets and torching government buildings. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto has claimed that his patience has limits, but so far the Ayotzinapa movement appears to have forced him into a corner.
Weekend Roundup. On the same day this week that President Obama announced a measure that could give legal protection to 5 million undocumented immigrants, massive protests raged across Mexico against the impunity and corruption that led to the horrific massacre of 43 students. From Mexico City, Sergio Sarmiento, Elena Poniatowska and Homero Aridjis chronicle the events and ponder what's next. Anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz examines the causes behind Mexico's corrosive impunity. \n\nMeanwhile, as Xin Chunying writes from Beijing, China is also seeking to establish the rule of law through steadily boosting the role of the National People's Congress. While stifling dissent, China's President Xi is taking on both \tigers and flies\ in his no-holds-barred assault from the top down on corruption. \n\nCan China's effort succeed without active public engagement? Can Mexico learn from China and move from angry protest to systemic change? (continued)
The Arabs' Next Decade. The Arab world's next ten years are dominated with uncertainty; the only fact that can be derived out of the current givens is that the best days in this area are behind and today's maps of the main states are liable to serious changes the might see new entities rising and old powers fading.
WHO. 
The Fall of the Would-Be Emperor. Turkey has the potential of becoming a significant global power, but to realize that, Erdogan must change course or leave. His arrogance, though, and self-styled piousness will prevent him from doing either and deny Turkey its deserving place to play a constructive role on the global stage.
Iran Nuclear Talks Deadline May Be Extended To March, Say Officials.

Cambodia Takes Multi-Pronged Approach to Confronting Gender-Based Violence. Supported by UN Women, the Government of Cambodia established a Technical Working Group on Gender and Gender-Based Violence, consisting of key line ministries, civil society organizations and development partners.
The Battle for Jerusalem. It will either be the last battle Palestinians will fight before Israeli Jews take East Jerusalem over. Or it is the first battle of a larger struggle -- in which Jerusalem serves as a magnet for militants from wherever they hail -- Sunni or Shia, secular and Islamist, takfiris, jihadis, or nationalists.
Despite Legal Gains, Turkish Women Are Still Dying Over The Right To Divorce. 
Israel's Move Into East Jerusalem Could Spark More Violence. 
In Jerusalem, Recent Violence Is Measured by a Long History. The \war to end all wars,\ as the Great War was called, has instead become a war that has never ended. No single city held more emotional and sacred power in the First World War than Jerusalem, a power that still resonates and still stirs conflict.
TentEd in Iraq; Interviews and Winter Edition. Since the first TentEd visit to Kurdistan, a lot has changed in the region so I sat down with its co-founder Zack recently to find out what he sees has been accomplished and what he thinks he can get done with another visit to the region.
My Brother Abdul-Rahman Kassig. James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, and now Abdul-Rahman Kassig.  Each of these men dedicated their lives to serving the long-suffering Syrian people, either by sharing with the world their stories and exposing the truth as journalists, or to alleviate their suffering as aid workers.
Empowering Young Africans With a Voice. While social problems continue to exist, there is a new storyline emerging from Africa. One that is full of promise and hope. It's about young people eager to learn, who embrace technology, want to start businesses, and take part in international trade.

Bridging the East with the West. For a man who is one of the top billionaires in Dubai, Khalaf Al Habtoor should rest easy. He is one of the most respected businessmen in the United Arab Emirates, has become an international figure, and is self-made. But he has more work to do.

America Is Not a 911 Number. On a recent visit to Europe I was most struck by the latent and open anti-American sentiments that are contaminating the political elites across the continent. This is especially strange in a year when we commemorate  the end of the Cold War.

ISIS Claims It Has Beheaded Another American Hostage. 
End the International Drug War to Control the Afghan Narco-State. The U.S. government has failed to stop the drug trade at home. Washington also has not created a competent, effective, and honest central government in Afghanistan. How effective will Kabul be in limiting opium production when American troops go home?

The more the name of Sinai can be reclaimed and coupled with positive associations and the more things might begin to change for its local Bedouin communities, whose livelihoods and name have suffered through misinformed narratives about the Sinai for too long.
What Is Fueling Rising Tensions In Jerusalem?. 
Weekend Roundup. It takes a strong state, not (to paraphrase Hillary Clinton) a democratic village, to aggressively fight climate change. This is the inconvenient message emerging in the wake of the Xi-Obama deal on global warming announced in Beijing this week. \n\nBoth leaders will pursue executive action to fulfill their pledges. As Kerry Brown writes, Xi's decision is binding within China because a long process of consultation and consensus building within the Communist Party stands behind it. What Obama can do is up for grabs. No sooner did the pledge escape his lips than the incoming Republican majority leaders in the U.S. Congress make their own pledge to block Obama by any means necessary.  \n\nIn The WorldPost this week, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim writes that the landmark Xi-Obama agreement is not only good for the environment, but also for the economy. Environmentalist Bill McKibben parses out \what the deal is, and what it isn't.\ (continued)

Uruguay's President Declines $1 Million Offer For Beloved Beetle. 
France's Prime Minister Knows What's in a Name. This is not the first time that Manuel Valls has proposed changing the name of the French Socialist Party. That he has returned to the subject from the vantage point of his present position -- which is, like it or not, the head of the majority -- obviously gives his suggestion new weight.
What Berlin (and Brussels) Can Teach Cairo and Washington. While business and trade promotion may not correspond to our desire for bald action in favor of democracy and human rights, they do, however, represent a fundamental step toward them. But most of all -- differently from bombs -- they can contribute to restore the US's most powerful tool of all
When Going to School Does Not Mean Learning. The second target of the U.N. Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), agreed upon in 2000 by world leaders and set to expire next year, is to \ensure that by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling.\ So, how far are we now?
Indira Gandhi. It's hard to believe now that three decades have rolled by since Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India was assassinated in her own garden in New Delhi by two Sikh bodyguards. India changed forever on that day.
The Trap of Islam's Eternal Conflict. There are many things the U.S. can do to help degrade and destroy ISIS, as President Obama claims as his goal. But letting ourselves get buried deeper into the middle of this centuries-old sectarian morass should not be one of them.
Armistice Day and WWI's Global Effects. What rapidly came to be called the \Great War\ was widely understood not just as a \world\ war but also as an \epochal\ moment in world history. It was the first \total war\ in which entire nations and peoples could be organized toward the waging of war.

Lessons of the Berlin Wall's Forgotten Aftermath. Though the Wende, or \Change,\ freed the East German people from over forty years of Stalinist dictatorship, remembering the forgotten side of German unification -- when right-wing hooligans waged thousands of attacks on defenseless foreigners -- provides a cautionary tale of failed leadership.

What Will Happen to Aasia Bibi?. I, as a practicing Muslim, hear these very brave, very resilient voices echo in a well, cyclically, in the asphyxiating, verging-on-blind bigotry of the confines of that hallowed institution called the court of law in a Muslim country called Pakistan.
The American People Have Punished Obama For His Weakness. The Republican-dominated Congress intends to rob Obama of the means to achieve a legacy, which Obama plans to weave through the nuclear negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
What Does German Unity Mean to the Post-Cold War Generation?. The Fall of the Wall in 1989 wasn't this generation's emotional joint \German\ experience; more probably, the FIFA World Cup 2006 was.
What Was the Biggest Battle Ever Fought?. There have been large and protracted actions defined as battles that have lasted weeks, months, or years. But if we want to narrow the definition of \battle\ to be defined as a single uninterrupted moment of conflict, then September 12, 1683 is a strong contender.

You'll Never Guess What Kim Jong Un Is Doing Now. 
This Is How Thoroughly Rotten and Corrupt Hong Kong's Government Is. As we know, there are many businesses set up by mainland interests in Hong Kong. They just have to appoint a dummy who is a Hong Kong permanent resident to go and vote on their behalf for the representative of their choice.
The Chance for a Multi-Ethnic Bosnia. Forging universal attachment to a multi-ethnic Bosnian state will not be easy, but the stakes for the West are high.

Ukraine Will Have to Live With Putin's Delusions. There is no practical solution to the Russo-Ukrainian war. The most one can hope for is to \freeze\ it and thereby transform hot war into cold war between Russia and Ukraine and between Russia and the West.

A War Worth Fighting, But We're Not There Yet.

The U.S. Wants to Contain Russia But Cooperate With China. The U.S. government believes that, as the inheritor of tsarist Russia and Soviet Union, Russia has expansionist and hegemonic traditions that China doesn't have. It believes Russia always has policies that challenge and attempt to supplant the existing international order while China doesn't. In many circumstances, China sees itself as a beneficiary of the current international order.

Obama Is Wrong That ISIS Is 'Not Islamic'. ISIS, in short, is as Wahhabist -- or more so -- as the Saudi King, Abdullah. There is here, surely, a delicious irony in Obama and Kerry taking upon their shoulders the task of seeking the \delegitimization\ of the very doctrine from which the Saudi kingdom is derived. The only upholder of \true Islam\ and custodian of Mecca happens to share the \same\ Islam as ISIS. How can King Abdullah then denounce it? And how could any Muslim, familiar with the issues, take any such denunciation -- were it to be made -- seriously?

The EU Provoked Putin, Not NATO. What provoked Putin early in November 2013 and later in February 2014 was not Ukraine-NATO integration, but rather EU accession. If anything, serious discussions of Ukraine's NATO membership in 2014 began after (not prior to) Russia's aggression against Ukraine.

Only These Three Steps Will Enable NATO to Stand Up to Putin. This dangerous 21st century will be safer if the West is strong together. A strong West means a strong and legitimate NATO built on strong and credible armed forces. Wales is the place and the time to act.  It is also the place and the time for NATO to be radical.

Now is the time for the West -- whether NATO, the United States, or individual European states --to provide or sell the high-tech weaponry Ukraine needs to defend itself effectively. The argument against such a move -- that it would provoke a Russian escalation--is no longer valid, now that Russia has escalated. A well-armed Ukraine could stop Putin from embarking on any of these more alarming scenarios.
On the Holocaust (From a Speech Given in Germany on August 20). Our moral test, even under these circumstances, is to continue to distinguish between enemies and innocents. Every time a child in Gaza dies it breaks my heart. They are not Hamas, they are not the enemy, they are just children.
Mass Urbanization Could Lead to Unprecedented Human Creativity -\u2013 But Only if We Do it Right. Successful global urbanization could lead to a profoundly-changed world in just a few decades, where age-old human problems of extreme poverty, famine, disease and conflict would be greatly alleviated -- if not eradicated.
Dismissal of Iranian Science Minister Rallies Both Support and Opposition for Moderate President Rohani. The impeachment of Iranian Minister of Science Reza Faraji Dana by the conservative-dominated Iranian Parliament on August 20 has been a key event for both sides -- a slip in the political tectonics that could yield seismic waves throughout the country's political landscape.

Egypt Has Regained the Palestinian Issue and Its Regional Leadership. Damascus is calling for internationalization as an opportunity for its rehabilitation.

Ebola, Experimental Pharmaceuticals, and Ethics. So far, medical personnel have been the primary beneficiaries of the drugs; will patients in the gravest danger receive drugs, or will those with the best likelihood of survival be the first to receive the serums?

It's the Racism, Stupid. It has been quite an eventful summer, and not in a good way. It seems as if the world is falling apart, even in parts of the world that are leading democracies, like us right here in the U.S. Most feel helpless and frustrated when we watch the news, and wish we could do more to stop the chaos.
What Makes Life Worth Living? Take a Moment to Ask. Various forces bigger than ourselves -- perhaps most of all marketing and pop culture - shape our goals without us realizing it, guiding our lives for us, often in directions that, were we to think about it, we would want to resist. Life becomes, for instance, a series of consumer decisions based on our preferences for this or that experience, or a mad race for some vaguely-defined \success.\

Weekend Roundup. Keeping to his credo of \don't do stupid sh*t,\ President Barack Obama sent in fighter planes to prevent ISIS from its genocidal assault on fleeing Yazidi refugees in northern Iraq, while also making it clear that the U.S. can just do so much. Only \inclusive\ and \non-maximalist\ governments in the Middle East, not deeper American intervention, he said in interviews this week, can ever stabilize the region. Peter Galbraith hailed this move against genocide as \The Obama Doctrine.\ Adel Guindy, an Egyptian Copt leader, called on the UN to live up to its pledge of \never again\ to protect religious and ethnic minorities persecuted by those practicing ISIS' brand of Sunni fundamentalism. And WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones recounted the harrowing stories of Yazidi families that found their way to the Turkish border. (continued)

Ayatollah Khamenei and Netanyahu. The main purpose of Ayatollah Khamenei's recent call to arm the Palestinians is to bring the West Bank under the control of Hamas and Islamic Jihad and do away with the more moderate PLO.  His attempt to exploit the unimaginable suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza is a reflection of his doctrine of 'victory through terrorization' (al-nasro-belrob).  \n\nFrom my point of view, this is the same policy that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pursuing by inflicting such horror on the people of Gaza.

Israel And Gaza Militants To Pause Attacks, But Invasion Is Still Seen As Likely. 
Western Leaders Who Demand Israeli Restraint. It is absolutely in the interest of Israel to destroy Hamas' capacity to make war and murder non-combatants, a position that the Obama Administration should be supporting Israel in accomplishing just at the United States is continuing to do against Al Qaida.
Journalist Shares Account Of Gruesome, Heartbreaking Gaza Attack. 
The Sheer Terror Of Being Alone With Our Thoughts. 
The Curse of the Occupation. At a time when hundreds of rockets are fired by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from Gaza against Israel -- threatening population centers, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv -- criticizing Israel's occupation of the West Bank would seem inappropriate at best. Many Israelis justify the continuing occupation in light of the intensifying violence. They argue that Israel cannot allow the West Bank to become under any circumstances like Gaza -- a staging ground for rocket attacks that could cause unimaginable death and destruction. The repeated acts of violence emanating from Gaza and the relative calm in the occupied West Bank are used to \validate\ this claim. In reality, the occupation itself is the root cause behind the unending Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the current deadly flare-up between Israel and Hamas.
What the World Cup Can Teach Progressives About Corruption. Apart from passionate support for their national sports teams, hatred of government corruption and \crony capitalism\ is one of the few issues that unite all social groups in developing countries.
Witnesses Of Blackwater Shooting Offer Damning Testimony. 
America's Tragic Turn in Germany and Japan. It's taken a long time for Germany and Japan to recover from the Second World War. After enduring the indignity of military occupation, they regained sovereignty only by guaranteeing against future threats to peace. Germany's new constitution only authorized military force in self-defense or in collaboration with collective security agreements. Japan's Article Nine went further, \forever renounc[ing] ... the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.\ But this post-war settlement is unraveling before our eyes. The Obama administration must learn to distinguish the urgent from the truly fundamental. Unless it rethinks our traditional post-war partnerships, it risks an authoritarian Japan and a profoundly alienated Germany -- destroying one of the greatest legacies of the twentieth century.
How To Stop Taking Our Lives For Granted. 
How to Achieve Israel's Stated Goal of Long-Term Quiet. There are too many wounds and grievances on either side to make bilateral negotiations between Israel and Palestine a success. By calling for a pact between Israel and Hamas, the United Nations is only postponing the next inevitable round of violence to another day.

Iceland, Music Festivals, Drug Use and Shocking Police Antics Under the Midnight Sun. In Iceland, there are shockingly harsh drug laws with possible penalties of up to 12 years imprisonment for sales and up to 6 for possession. Even in cases not involving prison time, the societal consequences from a criminal record can be substantial.
Before Unleashing Gaza-Like Airstrikes on Iraq, Congress Must Vote. In the early hours of Friday morning, Gaza's Ark - the boat preparing to sail from Gaza in defiance of the Israeli blockade on Palestinian exports - was hit by an Israeli missile and caught fire. When dawn broke Friday morning, little was left of the boat.
The Post-American Multiplex World. While elements of the old liberal order will survive, they will have to accommodate new actors and approaches that do not play to America's commands and preferences. The multiplex cinema is an apt analogy for today's post-American world. Several movies are running in different theaters within a single complex. Hollywood style includes thrillers and Westerns with violence, crime, ruggedness and heroism as prominent themes. Bollywood fare offers passion, tragedy, song and dance. Kung fu films produced in Hong Kong and Taiwan play next to patriotic and propaganda films from communist China. No single director or producer would monopolize the audience's attention or loyalty for long. The audience has a choice of shows.
Israel and Saudi Arabia. As states, Saudi Arabia and Israel share few, if any common values, despite some cultural values that are common to Wahhabism, the austere form of Islam adopted by the kingdom, and ultra-orthodox Jews. But they increasingly have common interests.

WATCH. 
The Post-Oslo Generation, Poised for a Third Intifada?. It is neither in Israel's nor in Hamas' interest to start a new war. The latter now has the means to strike Tel Aviv, and Netanyahu would struggle to survive politically if the heart of the Jewish state were badly hit. As for Hamas, it is already in dire straits. Gaza has been subjected to an Israeli blockade for seven years, and Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's Egypt tightened the grip further by destroying the hundreds of smuggling tunnels that were the economical lifeline for the 1.7 million Gazans.

Where's the Ukrainian Far Right Now?. Ukraine's far right has sunk to virtual electoral oblivion, and it's hard to know where or if it will reappear. Its role in defending protestors against the Yanukovych government, overthrown in February this year, didn't translate into widespread support in either the presidential election in May or in Kyiv's municipal elections.

Who's Afraid of the Caliphate?. Today respected clerics exist here and there, but many Muslims see the absence of a single authority as one source of the weakness and paucity of Islamic vision in the Muslim world today. In an era when the West has repeatedly invaded Muslim countries, overthrown their leaderships, and commandeered their economic and energy sources over much of the 20th century, the weakness and lack of leadership in the Muslim world remains a vivid concern to Muslims. Thus when the term \caliphate\ is invoked, it touches a chord in the historical sensibilities of many.
Mexican Vigilantes. Public opinion polls show that the majority of Mexicans believe self-defense is the best way to protect your community and a larger majority sees nothing wrong with vigilante justice. One could argue that such an outcome is predictable in a country where 105,000 people are kidnapped for ransom every year, where criminal groups blackmail one of every 10 Mexicans and 96 percent of recorded crimes go unpunished.
6 Militants Killed In Gaza Strip, Hamas Vows Revenge. 
Have We Gone From a Post-War to a Pre-War World?. Only a few years ago, most western observers believed that the age of geopolitical rivalry and great power war was over. Today, with Russian forces in Ukraine, religious wars exploding across the Middle East, and territorial disputes leading to one crisis after another in the East and South China seas, the outlook is darker. Serious people now ask whether we have moved from a post-war into a pre-war world. Could some incident somewhere in the world spark another global war?

Osama Bin Laden Is Getting Exactly What He Wanted. 
'Mission Accomplished' Reversed. The country has become the new Afghanistan -- a center of attraction and a training ground for the next generation of jihadist fighters who will be able to make use elsewhere of the fighting experience they get there. And now the same thing has happened in Iraq. ISIS cleverly used the porous borders with Syria to draw jihadists initially recruited for Syria into the neighboring country. ISIS can thus create the reign it so desires over an extensive territory comprising parts of Syria and northern Iraq. Since the Americans destroyed the Afghan symbiosis between al-Qaeda and the Taliban, no terror group has achieved anything like this. And it will draw more Islamist radicals from around the world who will either join ISIS or donate money. From that point of view, the Mosul victory was a successful PR coup.

It's High Time to Quell the Insurgency in Pakistan. A full scale military operation to rid Pakistan of the scourge of terrorism in the country's tribal belt has sparked a national debate, and defense analysts and experts on Afghan affairs and militancy have begun shedding light on the Karachi airport attack. Given that Pakistan has already reportedly suffered 49,000 casualties -- including the loss of more than 15,000 security personnel in its fight against homegrown insurgency -- and given the prospects of full throttle action against the militants in coming days, the government needs to focus on formulating an effective strategy to avoid civilian casualties in future situations. Hence, it is the high time to quell the insurgency through employing all the resources available.

Freed Taliban Commander Tells Relative He'll Fight Americans Again. 
Weekend Roundup. A furious war of words was unleashed at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore last weekend. The U.S. and Japan accused China of trying to change the status quo by coercion and intimidation; the Chinese accused Japan and the U.S. of inciting instability with its \20th century mentality\ of war and conflict. Following up on his comments in Singapore, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  writes in The WorldPost that China ought to abide by the rule of law in the seas of Asia and calls for negotiations.  Recalling the experience of World War II, Shanghai scholar/entrepreneur Eric X. Li  mocks Abe's pledge in Singapore that the \new Japanese\ will help their neighbors resist Beijing. The great danger now, writes the Australian scholar Hugh White , is that the ground is being laid for a catastrophic clash since both sides in this conflict assume incorrectly that the other will back down. South Korea's Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se  fears a \Pandora's box\ is being opened in Asia. Marking the 25 years since the Tiananmen massacre, China scholar Perry Link worries that Xi Jinping is becoming \a Mao-like strongman.\(continued)

The Impending 'Peaceful War' Between China and America Over Cyberspying. Unlike the Cold War period -- in which the Soviet Union was isolated from the global economy -- commercial interests and trade secrets underpin the intrinsically entangled Sino-American economic relations. The higgledy-piggledy distinction between national security and corporate interests is hardly convincing to the Chinese, especially when the US revolving doors conveniently inhabit the space between government service and corporations during both Democratic and Republican administrations. Just like the Sino-American relations in commercial intercourse, economics triumphs over ideology in the partisan world of American politics. On China's side, its intertwined national and economic interests are enshrined in the peculiar institution of the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).

He will feint to the left or right, as need be, but the key to understanding him is to judge him by his actions, not his words.
Nero Sworn in as the Prime Minister of India. This 26th of May, a 21st century Nero -- the man widely believed to be the mastermind of a 2002 pogrom that left thousands dead and many more mutilated -- has become the head of the world's largest democracy.
Is India Tiring of Democracy?. Not only has Modi secured a mandate to be \strong and decisive,\ but what appeals to the Hindu majority that elected him is his ability to ride roughshod over the processes of government, apparently in the interest of \good governance.\
Extremists Are Evolving \u2013- So Should We. Counterterrorism is not working. Retaliatory military actions, condemnation by world leaders and by the general public on social media and censorship of terrorist organizations have all proven futile. It's time to try something new.

India's New Parliamentarians Are Rich And In Trouble With The Law. 
Weekend Roundup. This week, watershed historical events have taken place in Asia. Narendra Modi and his modernizing Hindu nationalist party have swept to power in India. Scorned by the West over Crimea, Vladimir Putin has hastened to deepen Russia's energy and political ties with China. China seems to be creating as many enemies as friends with its new, boldly assertive posture. Appearing at a summit of non-Western nations in Asia after cementing the giant gas deal with Russia's Putin, President Xi appealed to his neighbors to keep the U.S. out of the region and leave Asia to Asians. Yet, this came on the heels of anti-China riots in Vietnam after China placed an oil rig in disputed waters. And it came just as the U.S. government indicted individual members of a People's Liberation Army cyber-espionage team for hacking into commercial secrets of American companies.

'Inclusive Growth' is Doublespeak. Here Are Three Ways to Really Achieve It. For anyone who cares to look, it will be obvious that the current Western model of economic growth, which has been adopted the world over, depends in no small part on excluding the majority in order to create wealth for a few. This has been the case since the colonial era. The same exclusion that was once practiced by the East India Company is now practiced on Wall Street and its excesses are accepted as part of the system by far too many governments. Developed world politicians, however, are all too happy to \include\ others in the world economy by outsourcing them cheap and dirty jobs or polluting industries.

I have also been urging listed companies to add at least one woman as a board member. By encouraging the advancement of women in society, we will raise our growth rate and promote \womenomics.\

ONE ON ONE. At just 26, Lily has already carved out an incredibly successful career as a model and actress and graduated from Cambridge University. On top of that, she's just launched Impossible.com, a website and app that encourages people to do things for others for free. It's based on the idea of a gift economy, a mode of exchange where things are not sold but given. The site encourages people to post wishes of things that they want or need help with, and offer what they can give. Lily says she hopes the site creates a community that fosters giving and receiving. \I called it Impossible, because I thought that a lot of people would say that it was impossible,\ says Lily. \It's an incredibly utopian proposition and I quite liked facing the cynics from the beginning with the name.\

How Apps Can Cause Us to Take Fewer Risks in the Game of Life. An \app mentality\ or \app consciousness\ -- the search for an app for everything, the almost automatic activation of an app and a concomitant reluctance to proceed if an app is lacking -- can be very limiting. And it is especially pernicious in the event that this mentality becomes the dominant mode, the dominant metaphor, for how one leads one's life.

Bridging the East-West Divide. In the 1970s and 1980s, the West European peace and environmental movement reached out, tentatively at first and then more vigorously, to the dissident groups in Eastern Europe.

Dispelling Discord between Japan and the U.S. Is an Urgent Task. President Obama has just completed a two-day visit to Japan for high-level meetings, including an unprecedented \three-star sushi shop conference\ with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Now that the two nations have reaffirmed their longstanding alliance, including a commitment by the U.S. to Japan's defense of the Senkaku Islands, I would like even more strongly to press for my suggestion that Mr. Abe to pay his respects at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial in Hawaii. This is because the gap in understanding between Japan and the U.S. remains a deep one, despite Mr. Obama's visit.
